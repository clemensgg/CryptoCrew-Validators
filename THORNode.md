# CryptoCrew - Support THORChain IBC Infrastructure

Bond Providers are officially invited to onboard CryptoCrew Validators as ecosystem infrastructure contributors for IBC Relayer Services.

## 1. Why is this needed?

With the upcoming integration of the IBC (Inter Blockchain Communication) protocol on THORChain, the $RUNE ecosystem is set to go through a major transformation. IBC will not only directly grow TVL and volume on THORChain, but enable new use cases for $RUNE throughout the Interchain ecosystem. Examples include:

- Deep Concentrated Liquidity Pools on Osmosis 
- RUNE as a gas token on multi-gas token chains like Neutron 
- RUNE as collateral on several lending protocols 
- Every other use case for RUNE on any Interchain DeFi protocol you can imagine

Furthermore, IBC is set to drive TVL and volume on THORChain through new sources of assets to swap, and enable new integrations of Thorswap on other Cosmos DeFi chains through IBC message-passing. Imagine Users seamlessly swapping their BTC position to native ETH before providing them as collateral on Mars via IBC. All controlled by the user with only one transaction on any IBC-enabled chain.

## 2. UX is everything

IBC Relayers connect IBC-enabled chains by relaying messages from the source to the destination chain. They are the connectivity tissue of the Interchain ecosystem. To ensure fast and reliable message-passing, Relayers utilize extensive and powerful infrastructure to avoid bottlenecks. This infrastructure is expensive and hard to maintain, and few teams have specialized to provide reliable high-throughput Relayer systems yet. In a fast-finality world users shouldn’t have to wait for minutes for their transaction to confirm. 

## 3. Why CryptoCrew?

[CryptoCrew](https://ccvalidators.com) is a major Validator, IBC Integrator, Relayer and Blockchain Node Infrastructure Provider in the Interchain ecosystem. We're a professional team with years of experience and have recently received [an AAA rating by StakingRewards.com](https://www.stakingrewards.com/provider/cryptocrew-validators).

We support 50+ mainnets in the Cosmos / Interchain ecosystem and have been selected as the major IBC Relayer Service Provider by high profile clients like Wormhole, Osmosis, Kava, [Neutron](https://forum.neutron.org/t/approved-proposal-9-relayer-services-for-neutron), [Persistence](https://forum.persistence.one/t/collaboration-with-cryptocrew-for-guaranteed-relayer-slas/317) and others. Our experience positions us uniquely for this role, our Relayers come with SLAs (99% uptime commitment) and have processed millions of transactions until today.

Our mission is to integrate THORChain with the wider Interchain Ecosystem, offering reliable connections with major DeFi Platforms like Osmosis, Injective, Neutron, Noble, dYdX, Celestia and more! Our team will be working closely alongside THORChain contributors and run relayers upon request. 

## 4. Support premium IBC Relayer Services on THORChain

By offering your Bond as a Bond Provider, you can directly fund CryptoCrew IBC Relayer Operations on THORChain. We strive to offer high coverage & reliability and will issue a 3-monthly Service Report ([example](https://forum.persistence.one/t/collaboration-with-cryptocrew-for-guaranteed-relayer-slas/317/22)) on this discord thread. 

We’re accepting flexible bond offers for bonds >50k RUNE, but reserve the right to decline offers we deem too low. A sensible number could be anything north of 15%. Exit conditions are flexible too. If we don’t receive enough bond we simply can’t offer our services. As a reference, our IBC relayers are priced between 5-20k USD per month, depending on the type of setup and number of counterparty chains included. 

Furthermore we’re excited to announce that `jp.thor` has provided the initial bond for our node as part of the RUJI 9.
