##OmniFlix contributors out of the gamenCurrently 5 OmniFlix validators outside of the active set despite the fact that they have delegations from OmniFlix team and|or foundation. These 5 validators were incentivized for participating in the testnets, providing RPC|REST endpoints, as well as analytical tools to the OmniFlix community. Here is the list: #76 - Wetez, #77 - NODEJUMPER, #78 - Architect Nodes, #79 - CosmosPug, #80 - 50% back. According to the proposal #10 that's was created for including the second part of testnet partisipants into the active set it's be fair to extend active set for 5 places for those OmniFlix contributors.n##Bottom linenIf this proposal will pass the number of active validators will be changed from 75 to 80.n##Discussionnhttps://commonwealth.im/omniflix/discussion/13175-attempt-2-validators-seats-increment
