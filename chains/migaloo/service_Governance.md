This proposal encourages validators to raise their minimum-gas-price from 0.25 uwhale to 1 uwhale on Migaloo.nnIn its early stages, the Migaloo chain set a default minimum-gas-price of 0 uwhale to support adoption and enhance the user experience. Proposal 5 increased the minimum gas price to 0.25 uwhale to prevent spam transactions. This proposal aims to increase the yield for stakers and validators and, at the same time, stimulate the economy around liquid-staked Whale and Alliance. It further prepares the network for the upcoming transaction fee burn, designed to counteract whale token inflation.nnVote YES to approve the minimum-gas-price increase.nVote NO to disapprove the minimum-gas-price increase.nVote NO WITH VETO to disapprove the minimum-gas-price increase and forfeit the proposal deposits.nVote ABSTAIN to abstain from the decision.

**Objective:** The Migaloo Foundation proposes to whitelist the Virtual Alliance Token (VT) on Migaloo.
**Reward Weighting:** The Migaloo Foundation seeks to assign VT a reward weight 0.05. This will allow the Foundation to support vital ecosystem areas without generating extra token inflation.
**Initial Asset Whitelisting:**
- **75% WHALE/USDC LP:** This will provide robust liquidity for Migaloo's primary pool.
- **20% mUSDC:** This encourages deposits into Ginkou, fortifying the lending and borrowing of amp and bone assets. These benefits extend to several liquid staking products from Backbone Labs and Eris Protocol, White Whale satellite markets, and Migaloo's NFT marketplace.
- **5% ASH:** This percentage supports the narrative of burning the whale.

**Ownership & Control:** The Migaloo Foundation retains control over the smart contract and the gauge, ensuring thoughtful testing and prompt decision-making. Eventually, the Foundation will provide a path for increased decentralization.
