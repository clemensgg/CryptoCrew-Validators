This proposal encourages validators to raise their minimum-gas-price from 0.25 uwhale to 1 uwhale on Migaloo.nnIn its early stages, the Migaloo chain set a default minimum-gas-price of 0 uwhale to support adoption and enhance the user experience. Proposal 5 increased the minimum gas price to 0.25 uwhale to prevent spam transactions. This proposal aims to increase the yield for stakers and validators and, at the same time, stimulate the economy around liquid-staked Whale and Alliance. It further prepares the network for the upcoming transaction fee burn, designed to counteract whale token inflation.nnVote YES to approve the minimum-gas-price increase.nVote NO to disapprove the minimum-gas-price increase.nVote NO WITH VETO to disapprove the minimum-gas-price increase and forfeit the proposal deposits.nVote ABSTAIN to abstain from the decision.
