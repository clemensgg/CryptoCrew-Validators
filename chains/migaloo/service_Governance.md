<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
Ash DAO has introduced a new token to the Migaloo ecosystem. As a result, a lot of new traders have come in, resulting in an explosion of trading but also a devaluation of ASH. We believe that ASH can be an important part of the ecosystem, and Ash DAO has great plans to make ASH valuable, thus supporting whale value and the burn movement.nnTherefore, we propose to increase the reward weight for ASH to 0.5%.nnWe would take 0.25% from the USDC-WHALE LP of VT Assets. mUSDC will remain untouched. As a result, the USDC-WHALE would be reduced from 3.75% to 3.5%.nnProposal:nnGiven the substantial value ASH brings to the Migaloo and WHALE ecosystems, its linkage to milestones, and the amount of Total Value Staked on Alliance, we propose to increase the reward weight for ASH to 0.5%. This adjustment will not only strengthen the ASH community but also facilitate the founding of the ASH DAO.
