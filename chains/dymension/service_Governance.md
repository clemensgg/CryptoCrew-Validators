<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
Let's get community support to change the Dymension code so tokens can't be transferred from locked accounts. Locked accounts have a start time when tokens are released, but can still stake tokens and get liquid rewards. For example, VCs have a 1 year lock up on the tokenomics.nnIt's super important for us as a community that token holders and stakers are on the same page. Trust in how tokens are distributed is key and we need to make sure locked tokens stay locked. Voting on this proposal will show whether you approve or disapprove of this change.
