<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
As part of the 2D upgrade, Virtual ERC-20 tokens enabled ICS-20 tokens to be represented as ERC-20 tokens in EVM wallets. This proposal registers the IBC tokens already existing on the Dymension blockchain with ERC-20 contract addresses. New tokens will be automatically registered, not requiring additional governance proposals.
