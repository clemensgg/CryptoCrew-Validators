# Summary:rnrnThis proposal advocates for an increase in the number of active validators to 125.rnrnBy doing so, we aim to provide smaller and newer validators with an opportunity to be actively involved in the Dymension ecosystem growth. This adjustment will not only foster a more inclusive validator community but will also encourage greater delegation from the broader community. Furthermore, including several community validators with significant contributions within the cosmos ecosystem and aligning them to reactivate their communities, continue to motivate them supporting the Dymension ecosystem.rnrnCurrently in the inactive set, there are approximately $8.4 millions DYM among the first 25 validators, meaning a significant number of delegators and validators with a total stake of $59 millions canâ€™t earn APR income and contribute to the network security. rnrnThe discussion and further details can be found here: https://forum.dymension.xyz/t/prop-1-updated-increase-the-active-validator-set-to-125/617rnrnrn##Vote options:rnrnThe following items describe the voting options and their significance for this proposal:rnrnrn- **YES**: You are in favor expanding the Validator set of Dymension to 125 Validators and include contributing Validators.rn- **NO**: You are not in favor expanding the Validator set of Dymension and believe the current Set should stay like it is. rn- **NO WITH VETO**: You expresses that you would like to see depositors penalized by revocation of their proposal deposit, and contributes towards an automatic 1/3 veto threshold.rn- **ABSTAIN**: You wish to contribute to quorum but you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.rn
