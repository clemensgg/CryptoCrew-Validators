<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
This proposal seeks to allocate 150,000 PASG tokens from the Passage Foundry to Apello. This will support the integration of Passage Chain into Apello, a toolkit for Cosmos-based projects and their communities.nAs the primary platform for community discourse, members of the Passage Discord will benefit from Apello's chain-based roles, functionality, and tools including:nRoles for NFT owners in the Passage ecosystem (such as Strange Clan and MetaHuahua).nRoles for PASG token participants (e.g., token holders, stakers, and liquidity providers).nToken-gated channels for exclusive community discussions.nSeamless verification based on token ownership and traits.nNFT sales tracker bot.nWeb app covering on-chain events like sales, listings, and bids.nSales leaderboard highlighting top collections by volume and timeframe.nnPassage Chain would join Juno, Terra, Stargaze, Teritori, and Injective as the sixth Cosmos chain integrated with Apello.nThe Passage Foundry accounts for 120,000,000 PASG. This proposal requests less than 0.1% of Foundry funds to be allocated to Apello for the benefit of the Passage community. One of the Foundry's core aims is ‚Äúfostering and supporting the creation of innovative and useful projects built on or in support of the Passage ecosystem,‚Äù and we believe Apello integration would directly align with this.nnAbout ApellonApello offers a comprehensive suite of free, open-source tools designed for Cosmos NFTs. nIt offers a wide range of features and functionality that enable communities to easily manage and track their NFT collections, such as token gating and sales tracking.nnProject Website: https://www.apello.xyz/ nDocumentation: https://use.apello.xyz/apello/ nGithub: https://github.com/Apello-xyz/ nDiscord: https://discord.gg/apelloxyz
