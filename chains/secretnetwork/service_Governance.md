In alignment with Cosmos Hub Proposal #93, we are proposing an open-source funding policy for Secret Network. nn We propose the following rules pertaining to all funding decisions made by Secret Network funding bodies (such as the community pool, grants, etc.): nn - Projects receiving funding from Secret Network MUST open-source their smart contracts before the mainnet launch. n - Wallet projects, where users store their private keys and interact with the chain, MUST be open source to qualify for funding.nn These requirements are in place to safeguard users. If open-source compliance conditions are not met, all funding for the project should be immediately halted. Once the open-source requirements are fulfilled, the remaining funding will be provided as previously agreed upon.nn Additionally, these rules shall apply:nn - The community pool can only fund open-source projects.n - Future grants can only fund projects where every component is open source.n - Projects need to be at least usable under the MIT or Apache 2.0 License. n - For grant applications it should be explicitly stated what is funded by Secret Network funding bodies nn Furthermore, we want to emphasize that all Secret Network funding should prioritize projects that are wholly open source.nn Places this has been discussed: nn 1. https://forum.scrt.network/t/secret-network-open-source-funding-policy/7123 n 2. https://forum.scrt.network/t/governance-meeting-notes-mega-thread/3946/130 n 3. https://t.me/SCRT_gov
