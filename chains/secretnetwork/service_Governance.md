<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
This proposal aims to bootstrap the first on-chain SCRT-PERP on Demex (dem.exchange), an all-in-one perp DEX in the Cosmos ecosystem. The proposal, put forth by the Switcheo Labs (switcheo.com) team, suggests co-hosting a trading competition with the Secret Network community to encourage traders to trade SCRT perpetual contracts, and provide liquidity to the SCRT perp pool. This is an on-chain community spend proposal. n n Forum post: https://forum.scrt.network/t/proposal-host-scrt-perp-trading-competition-on-demex/7131 n n Goal: n The main goal is to promote the awareness of SCRT-PERP to traders and liquidity providers, which will help to grow the SCRT community, we will propose a competition to reward traders and liquidity providers participating in SCRT-PERP. n n Distribution: n This proposal, if accepted, will spend $5,000 worth of SCRT tokens from the community pool, to the dev team address at `secret1fxxzd9w7qx27mat80gyj06n5jw8053v4chy283` on Secret Network in order to fund and incentivize the listing of $SCRT PERPS and a Secret Trading Competition on Demex. n n This sum will be used only for the purpose of payment of prizes to the winners of the competition. Winners will receive $USD (grouped stablecoin) on Demex within 60 days of the competition concluding. Any extra unused prize funds will be transferred back to the community pool fund. n n Total SCRT = `40,000USD / 0.355 (current price) README.md ccv.png ccvalidators_logo.png celestia_service_Governance.md chains chains.json chains.schema.json cosmoshub_service_Governance.md cryptocrew-validators-logo.png dydx_service_Governance.md juno_service_Governance.md osmosis_service_Governance.md relayers.json relayers.schema.json reports secretnetwork_service_Governance.md solva_logo.png update_governance_info.sh 1.05` = 14788 SCRT n Funding address = `secret1fxxzd9w7qx27mat80gyj06n5jw8053v4chy283`
