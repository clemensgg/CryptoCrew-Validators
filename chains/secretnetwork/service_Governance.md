<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
The Secret Network Foundation is excited to invite the Secret Network community to engage in the upcoming HackSecret IV, slated for Q3, starting in September. nn Reflecting on the success of this year‚Äôs HackSecret 2024 and HackSecret III, which garnered over 70+ innovative submissions and 10+ hackathon winners in total, we‚Äôre eager to maintain and amplify this momentum. Our aim is to attract new talent to Secret Network, encouraging development both natively and cross-chain. HackSecret project code also becomes reference material for future Secret developers.nn We have some early interest in this hackathon from a long-time Secret Network community member who is now teaching a university course on Web3 development. He intends to have his entire class of 30+ students participate in this hackathon, and would like to have some specific challenges laid out for them, which the Secret Network community could help come up with. nn HackSecret IV will be an opportunity for developers to showcase their skills and creativity. It will again feature two main tracks which will be split 50/50: a native deployment track for those looking to build entirely on Secret Network, and a cross-chain deployment track for those interested in creating cross-chain dApps using bridging technologies like SecretPath and Axelar GMP. This time we will also setup some extra ‚ÄúRFP‚Äù style bounties/requests. nn We also plan to feature additional tracks focusing on specific EVM chains that we support with cross-chain confidential computation tooling, which will be great opportunities for cross-community marketing and can help increase our overall prize pool. For example, we might have a ‚ÄúPolygon-Secret‚Äù track featuring a $5,000 bounty provided by the Polygon team, requiring developers to build a dApp using both chains. There might also be extra tracks sponsored by Secret Network DApps to bring the excitement of hackathons to our dApp layer.nn To ensure the success of HackSecret IV, we‚Äôre requesting funds from the community pool in the amount of 30,000 SCRT. nn These funds will solely be dedicated to rewarding the winning projects in this hackathon. As with previous iterations, HackSecret IV will be organized by the SNF and hosted on the Dorahacks platform. These funds would be held in a wallet owned by SNF, and would be distributed to winners with full transparency. nn Note that in the future, bounties like this will form part of SNF‚Äôs overall marketing budget request from the community, rather than being posed as a single item request. nn This initiative is not just about the competition; it‚Äôs about coming together as a community to foster innovation, collaboration, and the growth of Secret Network. Join us in making HackSecret IV a stepping stone for new developers and a showcase of the groundbreaking potential of our decentralized confidential computing (DeCC) technology. nn For more information on the proposal, please visit: https://forum.scrt.network/t/call-to-action-hacksecret-iv/7375 nn The total ask is 30000 SCRT.
