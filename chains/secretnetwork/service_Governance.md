<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
As outlined here (The API Proposal IV Revision B: https://forum.scrt.network/t/the-api-proposal-iv-revision-b/7101), we have reduced the amount of total nodes to the following three teams: nn 9 x thenodefather (secretnodes.com (defunct), CEO of Delta Flyer LLC (unknown status), CEO of Secret LLC (unknown status) and several other identities and shell companies) nn 9 x Secret Saturn nn 9 x Quiet Monkey Mind nn The current funds are handled by thenodefather (secretnodes.com). He holds the wallet (here: https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/address/osmo107wdqfgfa5v4kykahc2kg9syxe9yprayn7kacv) that has the funds for the API proposal and was supposed to handle the payouts according to my discretion. This arrangement was done in the past because he was one of API team leads, which he fully gave over to me at Oct 30th (see forum post here: https://forum.scrt.network/t/the-api-proposal-iv-revision-b/7101/11). nn As he does not want to make business with me anymore (which is unfortunate), he will not pay me my portion of the payout. nn This proposal covers my portion of the api team until we reach the next term in March: This would amount to 9 nodes x 150 $ per node x 4 months = 5400$ for this remaining period. nn Any extra, left over funds from my side will of course be paid back to the community pool. nn For more information on the proposal, please visit: https://forum.scrt.network/t/proposal-continuance-funding-for-api-team-for-secret-saturn/7176 nn The total ask is 15750 SCRT, based on the sum of 5400$, a SCRT price of 0.36$ and including the 5% volatility buffer. Any unused funds will be returned to the community pool as soon as possible. nn Places this has been also been discussed: nn 1. https://forum.scrt.network/t/governance-meeting-notes-mega-thread/3946/133 nn 2. https://t.me/SCRT_gov
