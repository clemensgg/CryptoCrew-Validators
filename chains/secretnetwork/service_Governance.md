In alignment with Cosmos Hub Proposal #93, we are proposing an open-source funding policy for Secret Network. nn We propose the following rules pertaining to all funding decisions made by Secret Network funding bodies (such as the community pool, grants, etc.): nn - Projects receiving funding from Secret Network MUST open-source their smart contracts before the mainnet launch. n - Wallet projects, where users store their private keys and interact with the chain, MUST be open source to qualify for funding.nn These requirements are in place to safeguard users. If open-source compliance conditions are not met, all funding for the project should be immediately halted. Once the open-source requirements are fulfilled, the remaining funding will be provided as previously agreed upon.nn Additionally, these rules shall apply:nn - The community pool can only fund open-source projects.n - Future grants can only fund projects where every component is open source.n - Projects need to be at least usable under the MIT or Apache 2.0 License. n - For grant applications it should be explicitly stated what is funded by Secret Network funding bodies nn Furthermore, we want to emphasize that all Secret Network funding should prioritize projects that are wholly open source.nn Places this has been discussed: nn 1. https://forum.scrt.network/t/secret-network-open-source-funding-policy/7123 n 2. https://forum.scrt.network/t/governance-meeting-notes-mega-thread/3946/130 n 3. https://t.me/SCRT_gov

This proposal aims to bootstrap the first on-chain SCRT-PERP on Demex (dem.exchange), an all-in-one perp DEX in the Cosmos ecosystem. The proposal, put forth by the Switcheo Labs (switcheo.com) team, suggests co-hosting a trading competition with the Secret Network community to encourage traders to trade SCRT perpetual contracts, and provide liquidity to the SCRT perp pool. This is an on-chain community spend proposal. n n Forum post: https://forum.scrt.network/t/proposal-host-scrt-perp-trading-competition-on-demex/7131 n n Goal: n The main goal is to promote the awareness of SCRT-PERP to traders and liquidity providers, which will help to grow the SCRT community, we will propose a competition to reward traders and liquidity providers participating in SCRT-PERP. n n Distribution: n This proposal, if accepted, will spend $5,000 worth of SCRT tokens from the community pool, to the dev team address at `secret1fxxzd9w7qx27mat80gyj06n5jw8053v4chy283` on Secret Network in order to fund and incentivize the listing of $SCRT PERPS and a Secret Trading Competition on Demex. n n This sum will be used only for the purpose of payment of prizes to the winners of the competition. Winners will receive $USD (grouped stablecoin) on Demex within 60 days of the competition concluding. Any extra unused prize funds will be transferred back to the community pool fund. n n Total SCRT = `40,000USD / 0.355 (current price) README.md ccv.png ccvalidators_logo.png celestia_service_Governance.md chains chains.json chains.schema.json cosmoshub_service_Governance.md cryptocrew-validators-logo.png dydx_service_Governance.md juno_service_Governance.md osmosis_service_Governance.md relayers.json relayers.schema.json reports secretnetwork_service_Governance.md solva_logo.png update_governance_info.sh 1.05` = 14788 SCRT n Funding address = `secret1fxxzd9w7qx27mat80gyj06n5jw8053v4chy283`
