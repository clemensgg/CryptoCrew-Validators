<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
 The Secret Network Foundation is excited to invite our community to engage in the upcoming HackSecret III, slated for Q2. Reflecting on the success of HackSecret 2024, which garnered over 30 innovative submissions, as well as the recent ETHDenver, ETHRome, and ETHBucharest hackathon winners, we‚Äôre eager to maintain and amplify this momentum. Our aim is to attract new talent to Secret Network, encouraging development both natively and cross-chain. nn HackSecret III will be a unique opportunity for developers to showcase their skills and creativity. It will feature two main tracks: a native deployment track for those looking to build entirely on Secret Network, and a cross-chain deployment track for those interested in creating cross-chain dApps using bridging technologies like SecretPath and Axelar GMP. We also plan to feature additional tracks focusing on specific EVM chains that we support with our cross-chain confidential computation tooling, which will be great opportunities for cross-community marketing and can help to increase our overall prize pool. For example, we might have a ‚ÄúPolygon-Secret‚Äù track featuring a $5,000 bounty provided by the Polygon team, requiring developers to build a dApp using both chains. nn To ensure the success of HackSecret III, we‚Äôre requesting funds from the community pool in the amount of 20,000 SCRT.nn These funds will solely be dedicated to rewarding the winning projects in this hackathon. As with previous iterations, HackSecret III will be organized by the SNF and hosted on the Dorahacks platform. These funds would be held in a wallet owned by SNF, and would be distributed to winners with full transparency. nn Note that in the future, bounties like this will form part of SNF‚Äôs overall marketing budget request from the community, rather than being posed as a single item request. nn This initiative is not just about the competition; it‚Äôs about coming together as a community to foster innovation, collaboration, and the growth of the Secret Network. Join us in making HackSecret III a stepping stone for new developers and a showcase of the groundbreaking potential of our confidential computing technology. nn For more information on the proposal, please visit: https://forum.scrt.network/t/call-to-action-hacksecret-iii-is-on-the-horizon/7274 nn The total ask is 20000 SCRT.
