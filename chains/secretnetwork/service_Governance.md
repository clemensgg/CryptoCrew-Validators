This proposal will update the, currently frozen, IBC Transfer Client for the channel 11-16 secret-chihuahua. The frozen client 07-tendermint-27 will be substituted by a new client 07-tendermint-184 . For questions about this proposal please contact Ertemann from Lavender.Five Nodes - Thank you to Alex from Secret Saturn for making the new Client! Upon completion of the proposal the community will once again be able to use sHUAHUA and transfer SCRT and any SNIP-20 back and forth between both chains.
