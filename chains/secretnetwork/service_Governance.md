# Secret Network v1.13 Upgrade

This proposal recommends that the chain undergo a software upgrade to version v1.13 of the Secret Network codebase on secret-4 block 14360000. The estimated time for the upgrade is **Thursday, May 23, 2024, at ~1pm UTC**.

Since block times can vary significantly, we advise monitoring the chain for a more precise upgrade time. ETA monitor: [mintscan.io/secret/blocks/14360000](https://dev.mintscan.io/secret/blocks/14360000).

## Upgrade Highlights

- DCAP attestation support
 - EPID attestation will still be supported, until it'd be phased-out by Intel
- Migration to SGX 2.20
- Bump github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v4 from 4.5.1 to 4.6.0.
## Upgrade Instructions
