We propose to update the Secret Ledger App to ensure it‚Äôs secure and robust for all users. This involves an app update and an audit by one of Ledger‚Äôs external auditors. nn The update adds Ledger Stax support, updates the app to the latest audited upstream as well as some smaller UX improvements. nn For more information on the porposal, please visit: https://forum.scrt.network/t/secret-ledger-app-audit/7116 nn The total ask is 13796 SCRT, based on the audit sum of 4730 USDC, a SCRT price of 0.36$ and including the 5% volatility buffer. Any unused funds for the audit will be returned to the community pool as soon as possible. nn Places this has been also been discussed: nn 1. https://forum.scrt.network/t/governance-meeting-notes-mega-thread/3946/130 nn 2. https://forum.scrt.network/t/governance-meeting-notes-mega-thread/3946/131 n 3. https://t.me/SCRT_gov
