### Proposal ID: 587
### Proposal Title: Create SEI Supercharged Pools
### Voting Period: 2023-08-21T10:52:07.241003361Z to 2023-08-26T10:52:07.241003361Z

<summary>Proposal Text</summary>

This proposal would create four new Supercharged Liquidity pools: 

* SEI/OSMO 0.2% Spread 
* SEI/OSMO 0.05% Spread 
* SEI/USDT 0.2% Spread 
* SEI/USDT 0.05% Spread

## Background 
During the rollout period, the creation of Supercharged Liquidity pools is permissioned by governance as established in [Proposal 532](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/532). 
## Choice of Pools 
The proposed pools are for the newly launched SEI mainnet. 
Pairings with OSMO is standard for most new listings. 
Pairings with USDT represent the stablecoin pairing. 

The higher spread factors mirror the typical spread factors used on Classic pools. The lower spreads will potentially be more efficient at collecting rewards for the same liquidity, as seen in other concentrated liquidity models but require more volume to reach the same fee generation and so are likely poor for initial bootstrapping purposes. The addition of two levels of the spread factor will enable the market to decide where liquidity reward collection is optimal as the markets grow.

### Proposal ID: 589
### Proposal Title: Create Initial Wormhole Supercharged Pools
### Voting Period: 2023-08-25T13:03:30.838570811Z to 2023-08-30T13:03:30.838570811Z

<summary>Proposal Text</summary>

This proposal would create nine new Supercharged Liquidity pools: 

* SOL/USDT 0.2% Spread 
* SOL/USDT 0.05% Spread 
* APT/USDT 0.2% Spread 
* APT/USDT 0.05% Spread 
* SUI/USDT 0.2% Spread 
* SUI/USDT 0.05% Spread 
* BONK/USDT 0.2% Spread 
* BONK/USDT 0.05% Spread 
* whUSDT/USDT 0.05% Spread 

## Background
During the rollout period, the creation of Supercharged Liquidity pools is permissioned by governance as established in [Proposal 532](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/532). 

## Choice of Pools 
The proposed pools are the planned initial assets provided by Wormhole to Osmosis. 

Wormhole was recently granted Canonical bridge status for these assets in [Proposal 582](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/582). 

Pairings with USDT are proposed as stablecoin pairings are more attractive to liquidity providers who only have to account for the volatility of one side of their position. 

These pairings will also be beneficial to Osmosis when the Taker fee, approved in [Proposal 530](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/530), is implemented as it will form additional yield to stakers as well as establish non-OSMO value in the community pool. 

The higher spread factors mirror the typical spread factors used on Classic pools. The lower spreads will potentially be more efficient at collecting rewards for the same liquidity, as seen in other concentrated liquidity models but require more volume to reach the same fee generation and so are likely poor for initial bootstrapping purposes. The addition of two levels of the spread factor will enable the market to decide where liquidity reward collection is optimal as the markets grow.
