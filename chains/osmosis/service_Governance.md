##Details:nThe Alpine DApp is a web application payment platform built on the Osmosis blockchain; designed to facilitate tipping of content creators using Osmosis tokens, users can now show their appreciation by making secure donations while including personalized messages to any social media user or content creator they wish to support.nnThe Alpine smart contract enables the core functionality of the DApp. It facilitates the creation and processing of tips, ensuring the secure transfer of Osmosis tokens from the sender to the content creator‚Äôs wallet address. Additionally, it enables the inclusion of personalized messages, allowing users to express their sentiments to the content creators.nnAdditionally, the Alpine web app builds upon the Alpine smart contract by making the concept fun, simple, and visually pleasing.

We also provide integrations for popular social media applications such as Twitter, Instagram, and GitHub so that users can easily identify their favorite streamer in our application.nnTo maintain control and governance, the Alpine smart contract will be owned by the Alpine Team.

On passing, this proposal would enable superfluid staking on the newly linked OSMO/USDC (#1133), OSMO/ETH (#1134), and OSMO/ATOM (#1135) supercharged liquidity pools on Osmosis. This will also allow for superfluid staked positions in the traditional GAMM pools to migrate to the linked supercharged liquidity pools
