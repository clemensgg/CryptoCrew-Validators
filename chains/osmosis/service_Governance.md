This proposal aims to store the Wasm code for the nois-proxy contract. 
 This contract is needed for the randdrop contract to pull the beacon from Nois. Once instantiated it will allow eligible Osmosis stakers to participate in the randdrop. This contact will also permissionlessly allow any other contract on osmosis to have access to unbiased and publicly verifiable randomness.
