This proposal adjusts the Osmosis Liquidity Incentives emitted to each pool according to the methodology in [Proposal 578](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/578) as well as implementing [Proposal 638](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/638). 

 New Incentives and Targets for the pools retaining incentives can be found on the [Chaos Labs Dashboard](https://community-staging.chaoslabs.xyz/osmosis/incentives-optimization).

This proposal asks that the incentives program migrates from incentivizing USDC.axl pools to the equivalent IBC native USDC pairings. 
## Background 
With [Proposal 624](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/624), Osmosis governance has recognized IBC native USDC via Noble as the canonical version of USDC. 

This status comes with the promise that the canonical status of USDC will receive higher incentives than the non-canonical version. 

This proposal would cause the transfer of incentives from the currently incentivized USDC.axl pools to the equivalent newly created USDC supercharged pools over a period of at least two weeks, culminating in removing the USDC.axl pools from the incentives system. 

* OSMO / USDC.axl, [1133](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/1133), 0.2%, Receiving 5,370.63 and migrating to OSMO / USDC, [1221](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/1221), 0.2% 
* USDC.axl / USDT, [1080](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/1080), 0.05%, Receiving 89.22 and migrating to USDT / USDC, [1220](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/1220), 0.05% 
* USDC.axl / USDT, [1081](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/1081), 0.01%, Receiving 89.22 and migrating to USDT / USDC [1220](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/1220), 0.05%

As there is no bonding period for Supercharged liquidity pools and the Transmuter is in place for users to easily transfer their position between these pools, the two-week period only applies to the OSMO/USDC.axl pool, which is still undergoing migration from the original bonded Classic pool. 

This proposal, therefore, directly transfers all native incentives from the USDC.axl/USDT pools to the new USDT/USDC pairing as well as directly transferring half of the current OSMO incentives from the OSMO / USDC.axl pool to the new OSMO / USDC pool. 

The remaining incentives in the OSMO / USDC.axl pool will be moved to the OSMO / USDC pool in the next routine incentives proposal, expected at the start of November.
