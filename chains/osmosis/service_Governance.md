Teritori, a Cosmos SDK Layer 1 blockchain and a superdApp, has its utility token, TORI, which is essential for governance and accessing diverse features of the superdApp.
The TORI token was launched on October 3, 2022, and has been traded on Osmosis for many months (Osmosis Pool 816).

This proposal aims to verify the TORI token as a verified asset on Osmosis.
