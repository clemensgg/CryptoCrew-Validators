- This is a joint proposal prepared by representatives of the Osmosis Community (RoboMcGobo 2, Johnny Wyles 1) and MantaDAO (Pragmatic Monkey, Vladimir GG, PostTenebras 2)n- We are proposing a $50k OSMO<>MNTA token swap between our two Communities.n- MantaDAO will match the received OSMO with another $50k of MNTA in a BOW LP (the AMM built on top of FIN, Kujira‚Äôs orderbook DEX).n- Osmosis Community Pool will match the received MNTA with another $50k of OSMO in a +/- 5x position in the Supercharged pool on Osmosis, with the option to re-evaluate this when vaults are available.n- This will result in $200k of OSMO/MNTA liquidity that will make the two tokens tradable with limited price impact against a wide variety of assets on both Osmosis and Kujira thanks to Osmosis and MantaSwap‚Äôs multihop routers.n- Half of the LP ($100k on Osmosis) will be owned by Osmosis Community Pool; the other half ($100k on BOW) will be owned by MantaDAO.n- This will sustainably deepen liquidity for OSMO on Kujira in the form of Protocol-Owned Liquidity without the need for any incentives.n- This will enable the Osmosis Community to diversify its treasury and generate a source of income in the form of trading profits from market-making activities.n- This will open up additional arbitrage routes between Osmosis and FIN, resulting in a net increase in trading volumes on both sides.n- This will build a bridge between the Osmosis and Kujira communities, promoting net positive-sum cooperation across the Cosmos.nnThe recipient address (osmo1rfcf70z0052zsjp9kz9zgal93exljj3fgka75wve0e3sazq724mqv2vqdm) is the multisig address controlled by the members from the Osmosis community:nnRoboMcGobo (https://twitter.com/RoboMcGobo 2)nnLuisqa (https://twitter.com/luisqagt)nnGolden Ratio Staking (https://twitter.com/GoldenStaking)nnnThe requested amount of OSMO and MNTA for exchanging and matching is calculated on a 10d TWAP basis: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/1u5lbIR9_Vl52munAtjg8S0j3_0v_KqLzOZKhy0pMSjY/edit?pli=1#gid=0nnnThe full text of the proposal and discussion: https://forum.osmosis.zone/t/mutual-token-swap-between-osmosis-and-mantadao/343

# SummaryrnThis proposal aims to deploy 20M OSMO to the [stOSMO/OSMO stableswap pool 4](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/833) (#833).rnrnDoing so would eliminate the need to spend internal OSMO incentives for stOSMO liquidity, reducing OSMO emissions. Furthermore, this would create deep stOSMO liquidity, enabling Mars to safely approve stOSMO as collateral. Membrane and Levana would also likely be able to use stOSMO as collateral.rnrnThe amount of OSMO specified was calculated using Mars' rigorous Risk Framework. This amount would enable Mars to safely add stOSMO as collateral, with decent parameters.rnrnThe OSMO would be sent to a 4/6 signature scheme DAODAO multisig controlled by trusted community members. The multisig would provide the OSMO as liquidity, and then transfer the resultant LP tokens to the Osmosis community pool.rnrnSo instead of the 20M OSMO sitting idle in the community pool, it would be sitting in the stOSMO/OSMO pool, facilitating efficient stOSMO trading and generating fee revenue for OSMO stakers. And by holding the LP tokens, Osmosis governance would have complete control of the liquidity position.rnrn## Governance votesrnThe following items describe the voting options and their significance for this proposal:rn* **YES**: You wish to deploy 20M OSMO to the stOSMO/OSMO stableswap pool, to enhance Osmosis DeFirn* **NO**: You do not wish to deploy OSMO protocol owned liquidityrn* **NO WITH VETO**: You 1) consider this proposal to be spam, 2) believe it infringes on minority interests, or 3) believe it violates the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance. If the number of NoWithVeto votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burnedrn* **ABSTAIN**: You wish to contribute to quorum but you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposalrnSee full details and the community discussion on the forum:rnhttps://forum.osmosis.zone/t/deploy-20m-osmo-to-the-stosmo-poolrn
