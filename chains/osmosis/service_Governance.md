<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
This proposal aims to store the Wasm code for the nois-randdrop contract. 
 Once instantiated it will allow eligible stakers to participate in the randdrop.
 Ps: If this proposal passes we would raise another proposal to store the Nois proxy contract that acts as an outpost contract on osmosis to allow requesting the unpredictable randomness (Needed to conduct the randdrop). The snapshot that we would use for the randdrop has been taken at height 12542000 and you can check the full list of eligibility here https://github.com/noislabs/randdrop-snapshots/tree/v0.1.0
