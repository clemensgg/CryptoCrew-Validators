# SummaryrnThis proposal aims to deploy 20M OSMO to the [stOSMO/OSMO stableswap pool 4](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/833) (#833).rnrnDoing so would eliminate the need to spend internal OSMO incentives for stOSMO liquidity, reducing OSMO emissions. Furthermore, this would create deep stOSMO liquidity, enabling Mars to safely approve stOSMO as collateral. Membrane and Levana would also likely be able to use stOSMO as collateral.rnrnThe amount of OSMO specified was calculated using Mars' rigorous Risk Framework. This amount would enable Mars to safely add stOSMO as collateral, with decent parameters.rnrnThe OSMO would be sent to a 4/6 signature scheme DAODAO multisig controlled by trusted community members. The multisig would provide the OSMO as liquidity, and then transfer the resultant LP tokens to the Osmosis community pool.rnrnSo instead of the 20M OSMO sitting idle in the community pool, it would be sitting in the stOSMO/OSMO pool, facilitating efficient stOSMO trading and generating fee revenue for OSMO stakers. And by holding the LP tokens, Osmosis governance would have complete control of the liquidity position.rnrn## Governance votesrnThe following items describe the voting options and their significance for this proposal:rn* **YES**: You wish to deploy 20M OSMO to the stOSMO/OSMO stableswap pool, to enhance Osmosis DeFirn* **NO**: You do not wish to deploy OSMO protocol owned liquidityrn* **NO WITH VETO**: You 1) consider this proposal to be spam, 2) believe it infringes on minority interests, or 3) believe it violates the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.
