## Background
During the rollout period, the creation of Supercharged Liquidity pools is permissioned by governance as established in [Proposal 532](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/532). 

## Choice of Pools
The proposed pools are those that have either been requested by the community for listing or have struggled to gain sufficient liquidity to facilitate trading by having consistently high swap APR and no incentives. 

As these are currently tail assets on Osmosis, they are being created with just the one higher spread factor, which should make LPing more profitable for immature markets compared to the current pools in use. 

This is 0.2% for volatile assets and 0.05% for Stable or Equivalent pairings. 

SILK and USK Supercharged pools add USDT pairings for two stablecoin projects that have never been incentivized outside of their native chains. 

YieldETH brings Sommelier's Real Yield ETH strategy into the Cosmos over the Axelar bridge. The addition of a Supercharged liquidity pool for this should allow functional trading to occur with minimal barriers from bridging fees. 

Wormhole pairings do not guarantee inclusion as verified assets, but provide an alternative liquidity route for assets transferred via Wormhole from Ethereum to trade on Osmosis until the future Transmuter contract is in use. 

Composable is preparing to launch the IBC connection to Polkadot, and this proposal would create initial pairings as Supercharged pools. 

StreamSwap alumni often have large pools from the initial launch, but have no stablecoin pairings. Several teams have requested Supercharged pools, so these are being proposed as a category. 

Current volatile Classic pools: 
* ARCH - [1061](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/1061) - 47% Swap APR
* KUJI - [744](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/1061) - 47% Swap APR 
* LUNA - [726](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/726) -18% Swap APR, functional liquidity currently failing to establish on Osmosis. 
* LUNC - [800](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/800) - 83% Swap APR
* NTRN - [1046](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/1046) - 67% Swap APR

Requested by their communities include USDT pairings for pools of BCNA, CUDOS, JKL, REGEN, SHD and WHALE. 

MANTA will also be listed soon and wishes to have the liquidity efficiency that comes from the Supercharged pools.

### üó≥ 616: Incentivise SOL/USDT Supercharged Pools
- Voting Start: Wed Sep 06 2023 16:26:34 UTC
- Voting End: Mon Sep 11 2023 16:26:34 UTC

<details>
<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
This proposal asks that the pools comprising the SOL/USDT Supercharged pairings created in [Proposal 589](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/589) be added to the Osmosis incentives program and directly allocates 0.5% of incentives to each pool to bootstrap liquidity. 

This proposal would also recognize SOL as a Major asset. Although the category system is no longer in place since [Proposal 578](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/578) and so do not allocate additional rewards, this list can be used for reference of a group of strategically important assets for Osmosis.

On passing, this proposal would enable superfluid staking on the newly linked OSMO/USDC (#1133), OSMO/ETH (#1134), and OSMO/ATOM (#1135) supercharged liquidity pools on Osmosis. This will also allow for superfluid staked positions in the traditional GAMM pools to migrate to the linked supercharged liquidity pools
