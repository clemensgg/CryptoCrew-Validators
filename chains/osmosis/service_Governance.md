<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
This proposal asks that the pools comprising the SOL/USDT Supercharged pairings created in [Proposal 589](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/589) be added to the Osmosis incentives program and directly allocates 0.5% of incentives to each pool to bootstrap liquidity. 

This proposal would also recognize SOL as a Major asset. Although the category system is no longer in place since [Proposal 578](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/578) and so do not allocate additional rewards, this list can be used for reference of a group of strategically important assets for Osmosis.
