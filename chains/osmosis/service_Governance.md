Due to an unforeseen relayer issue that resulted in the subject client exceeding the trusting period, the IBC client 07-tendermint-71 used by channel-15 for IOV transfers from Starname to Osmosis is currently in an expired state. If accepted, this proposal will update client 07-tendermint-71 with the data from 07-tendermint-2952 which is created newly, so that users may continue to take advantage of both the established channel.

### üó≥ 600: Upload Transmuter Contract v1

Transmuter is a CosmWasm contract that allows 1:1 conversion of one asset to another. 

Transmuter would be the first CosmWasm Pool to be uploaded to Osmosis, a pool type fully integrated with Osmosis‚Äô existing pools but created via the instantiation of a CosmWasm contract, allowing deployment of new pool types without software upgrades. 
## Details
Once instantiated with two assets, the contract functions as a pool with a fixed 1:1 ratio of token value, no matter the ratio of the assets in the pool. 

[Classic curve (Red), Stableswap (Blue) and Transmuter (Green)](https://imgur.com/ZvvBErC) 

For traders, this enables the Transmute function which allows the exchange of 1 unit of value of a token they possess that is in the pool with 1 unit of value of any other token that is present in the pool without any slippage. 

For liquidity providers, one token can be added to the pool in exchange for a representative token of that value held within the pool. Owners of the representative tokens can choose which asset to withdraw from the pool. 

As there is zero slippage or fee, liquidity providers must either be altruistic or obtain an alternative benefit for adding tokens to the pool. 

## Potential Uses 
V1 of the Transmuter may be used to convert freely between identical tokens of different origins, such as axlUSDC and native USDC, to aid migration. As there is no benefit for liquidity providers to maintain a usable ratio of tokens, this would likely only be in use over a token‚Äôs transition period rather than a stableswap pool with a small swap fee.

Passing this proposal will upload the WBTC CosmWasm contract to the Osmosis chain and recognize WBTC minted through this contract as the Canonical version of WBTC on Osmosis as the most native version. 
## Details
WBTC brings Bitcoin liquidity to Defi by providing a token usable in smart contracts, backed 1:1 with Bitcoin verifiably held by a community of Custodians. 

As an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, WBTC has allowed Bitcoin liquidity to be used across DeFi use cases rather than being restricted to trading on Centralised Exchanges. 

This contract enables the WBTC issuance and redemption process as a native token on Osmosis. 

Website: [https://wbtc.network/](https://wbtc.network/)
## Contract Details
The WBTC contract allows the issuance and redemption of WBTC according to Bitcoin present in the custodian‚Äôs wallet on the Bitcoin blockchain at the request of merchants. 

Merchants perform key roles for the WBTC community as administrators who initiate the process of minting newly wrapped tokens and burning wrapped tokens which is performed by the Custodians. 

The custodian provides reliable, institutional-grade security for your WBTC. All WBTC issued will be fully backed and verified through on-chain proof of reserves. 

The addition and removal of merchants and custodians for WBTC on Osmosis will be an open process controlled by a multi-signature contract. Keys to the multi-sig contract will be held by institutions as part of the [WBTC DAO](https://osmosis.daodao.zone/dao/osmo1ltlaul7tfvm92jj3spsfl2hj2926zr325jzt5c6mx4f3r5a872js8ax5af/proposals) 

Oak Security has audited the contract, which can be viewed here: [https://github.com/oak-security/audit-reports/blob/master/Osmosis%20Labs/2023-08-18%20Audit%20Report%20-%20CosmWasm%20WBTC%20v1.0.pdf](https://github.com/oak-security/audit-reports/blob/master/Osmosis%20Labs/2023-08-18%20Audit%20Report%20-%20CosmWasm%20WBTC%20v1.0.pdf)

## Contract Information
**Release Version**: [V1.0.0](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/cw-wbtc/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

**Git Commit ID**:876f865e0b06e519384808efe84ee906d8746c05

**Code Location**: [https://github.com/osmosis-labs/cw-wbtc](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/cw-wbtc)

**Compiler Version**: cosmwasm/workspace-optimizer:0.14.0

**Checksum**: f6dccc84a35b3ddc8b289ca45564eee15b3c76d1eeb8807ab2763dd83787a9fe

## Canonical Status
As part of this proposal, Osmosis recognizes the WBTC minted via this contract as the canonical version of WBTC on Osmosis. 

Canonical status sets the following agreement: 

**Default Asset List**
Assets will be unprefixed in the app.osmosis.zone default asset list, e.g. WBTC with all other bridges‚Äô assets being bridge1WBTC, bridge2WBTC, etc. Osmosis DAO requests that allied/friendly front-ends do the same, though any front-end is free to make its own decisions. 

**Osmosis Incentives**
The DAO commits to prioritizing the Canonical Bridge assets, incentivizing them earlier and more heavily than the comparable assets of non-canonical bridges. In general, canonical pools should earn substantially more incentives per dollar of liquidity than their counterpart pools‚Äìunder the base incentives model, not necessarily counting external incentive matching. 

This proposal does not directly impact the incentives currently provided to the axlWBTC/OSMO pool (712), which will be reallocated in a future proposal.

### üó≥ 605: Signaling Proposal: Remove Unverified Status from Gelotto (GLTO) Token

The Gelotto (GLTO) token was launched in June of 2022 and has been actively traded on Osmosis. However, the unverified status given by Osmosis creates an unwanted perception towards the asset, deterring new users and causing additional steps for existing users. This proposal aims to remove the unverified status of GLTO. More details can be found on the forum discussion: https://forum.osmosis.zone/t/signaling-proposal-remove-unverified-status-from-gelotto-glto-token/236
