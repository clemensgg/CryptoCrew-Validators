<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
This proposal would create 29 new Supercharged Liquidity pools, all of which have been proposed as OSMO paired supercharged pools in previous proposals. 

## Background
During the rollout period, the creation of Supercharged Liquidity pools is permissioned by governance as established in [Proposal 532](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/532). 

## Choice of Pools
The proposed pools are all pools that have been proposed as OSMO supercharged pools with some exceptions: 

ETH, can currently only be a Quote asset due to the 18 exponent issue, and Stablecoins should be used as Quote where possible. 

WBTC, which will have a native deployment proposed soon which will be proposed as the Canonical version of WBTC. 

DOT, which has Composable listing soon which will be proposed as the Canonical version of DOT. 

CMST, due to the uncertainty around the recent Harbor exploit impact. 

Pools are created with 0.2% spread factor, and 0.05% spread factor alternatives for larger (Major or >m TVL) pools.
