This proposal requests a bootstrapping incentive spend for the launch of dYdX token liquidity on Osmosis.nn## About dYdXnndYdX is an established perpetuals exchange running v3 of the [open-source dYdX software](https://github.com/dydxprotocol/) at [dydx.exchange](https://dydx.exchange/).nndYdX [voted](https://snapshot.org/#/dydxgov.eth/proposal/0x17026e18317dc29fe745d3130246a83b1485612da9c97e7261e8f659cf33663c) to migrate to a new, IBC-enabled appchain running the v4 dYdX software earlier this year. This includes the launch of a staking token to govern voting power on the dYdX chain.nnThe current dYdX token on Ethereum, now known as ethDYDX, can be locked in a smart contract in return for both a corresponding DYDX token on the new chain governing v4 of the software as well a wethDYDX token on Ethereum, which will continue to govern v3 of the software.nn## Incentive spendnnThis proposal requests a community pool spend to incentivize liquidity on Osmosis for the DYDX token from the dYdX chain.nnThe pool will be 0.05% spread factor Supercharged pool paired with USDC.nnAs of [Proposal 638](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/638), Osmosis no longer allocates ongoing internal incentives to most pools.nnBy spending specific quantities of incentives with a fixed end date, initial liquidity can be crowdsourced for a pool to launch new markets on Osmosis. After the market has been established, these external incentives will end, and the market will reach a sustained level of liquidity through trading fees alone.nn## Why is dYdX liquidity important to Osmosis?nnAs an established project on Ethereum, dYdX currently has around [4,000 active traders](https://dydx.metabaseapp.com/public/dashboard/b3e36e1f-6860-4ecb-8f8b-96ca727f4609) despite current market conditions. Osmosis becoming the main place to trade the governance token may attract new users who were typically Ethereum natives but have recently installed Cosmos-compatible wallets to interact with the new version of dYdX.nnAs the liquidity hub for the Cosmos, Osmosis will form the primary spot market for dYdX‚Äôs perpetual markets. Increased activity and adoption of dYdX v4 over v3, therefore, will attract further volume to Osmosis, and so it is in Osmosis‚Äô interests to incentivize migration by enabling an active dYdX market.nndYdX is also the first prominent app to choose to migrate to a dedicated appchain, demonstrating Cosmos‚Äô vision of a multi-chain future connected by IBC. Supporting established apps to move to an appchain grows the usage of the Cosmos as a whole. Osmosis can assist here by increasing liquidity depth outside the original monolithic chain during launches.nn## Requested SpendnnThis proposal requests 200,050 OSMO to be spent as follows:nn* 200,000 OSMO to the DYDX / USDC pool over 50 days to source liquidity for DYDX in the Cosmos. (Approx $1000 per day)n* 50 OSMO for the gauge creation fee.nnFifty days should give sufficient time for the liquidity market to establish. The recent USDT launch took around 30 days for incentives to develop [reliable volume](https://info.osmosis.zone/token/USDT), so incentives should be around longer than this to ensure the market is well established.nnThe quantity of OSMO has been chosen as a spend equivalent to ten days of the redirected incentives removed in [Proposal 638](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/638). This aims to ensure that the incentives are substantial to attract liquidity primarily to Osmosis while not raising inflation significantly compared to that proposal‚Äôs reduction.nn## Funding managementnnThis proposal spends the requested OSMO into a multisig on DAODAO to be loaded to the specified pool by the members.nnAll incentives will be loaded to the relevant gauge as soon as the pool is freely available for trading on Osmosis.nnMembers of the multisig are:nn* Chorus One (DYDX and Osmosis Validator)n* Johnny Wyles (Osmosis Labs)n* RoboMcGobo (Osmosis Community and DYDX Grants Program)nnForum Post: [https://forum.osmosis.zone/t/dydx-incentive-spend/445](https://forum.osmosis.zone/t/dydx-incentive-spend/445)

This proposal requests a bootstrapping incentive spend for the launch of Celestia (TIA) token liquidity on Osmosis.nn## About CelestiannCelestia is a new type of blockchain that aims to launch a new modular paradigm where each chain is minimal in composition and highly specialized to perform specific tasks. This specialization provides breakthroughs in scalability, flexibility, and interoperability, enabling developers to build blockchain applications for mass adoption.nnCelestia is specialized as a data availability blockchain with the TIA token used to pay for blobspace. This allows new blockchains to be spun up without their own native token, instead using TIA similarly to ETH on Ethereum-based rollups. Developers may opt to bootstrap their chain quickly by using TIA as a gas token and currency, in addition to paying for data availability. In this mode, developers can focus on creating their application or execution layer instead of issuing a token right away.nn## Incentive spendnnThis proposal requests a community pool spend to incentivize liquidity on Osmosis for the TIA at the launch of the Celestia chain.nnThis pool will have a 0.05% spread factor Supercharged pool paired with USDC.nnAs of [Proposal 638](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/638), Osmosis no longer allocates ongoing internal incentives to most pools.nnBy spending specific quantities of incentives with a fixed end date, initial liquidity can be crowdsourced for a pool to launch new markets on Osmosis. After the market has been established, these external incentives will end, and the market will reach a sustained level of liquidity through trading fees alone.nn## Why is TIA liquidity important to Osmosis?nnThe modular blockchain paradigm is an extension of the appchain thesis, with each blockchain focusing on its own specialty. As a modular blockchain focussed on data availability, Celestia is deliberately unable to run a native exchange, and so the dominant decentralized exchange for TIA must be run on another chain.nnOsmosis should not only be aiming to be the decentralized exchange of choice for TIA, but also be the connector between all IBC chains, such as Celestia, and all other modular blockchains and rollups that will use the Hyperlane bridge. Building TIA liquidity is the first step towards Osmosis becoming the crossroads of liquidity trading for the emerging modular blockchain ecosystem.nnSee this talk at this year‚Äôs Modular conference for more information on Osmosis and Celestia: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DVwjwYvPsknn## Requested SpendnnThis proposal requests that a 300,000 OSMO budget be granted to incentivize liquidity of the TIA token with the following restrictions.nnThe incentives program will start when TIA is listed on Osmosis and freely available to trade.nnThe incentives program will last no more than 50 days to give sufficient time for the liquidity market to establish.nnThe quantity of OSMO has been chosen as a spend equivalent to fifteen days of the redirected incentives removed in [Proposal 638](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/638).nnNew Proof of Stake networks can have issues attracting staking security as well as trading liquidity. Some tokenomic designs have a high level of inflation in order to attract community stakers, but the [initial inflation of the Celestia chain is 8%](https://docs.celestia.org/learn/staking-governance-supply/#inflation), and all tokens, including vested, may be staked. This is comparable to the standard across the Cosmos and should result in an expected staking return of 12%-16% at typical bonding levels for proof of stake chains.nnAll incentives may not be spent as they will be loaded according to the following methodology:nn* Minimum spend of 3000 OSMO per day (150,000 over the period)nn* Maximum spend of 6000 OSMO per day (300,000 over the period)n* Week 1 incentives to be loaded as the maximumn* Week 2 onwards then revise within these restrictions as per the formula:nnValue per day = Celestia Staking rate per day README.md ccv.png ccvalidators_logo.png chains chains.json chains.schema.json cosmoshub_service_Governance.md cryptocrew-validators-logo.png osmosis_service_Governance.md relayers.json relayers.schema.json reports solva_logo.png update_governance_info.sh Pool TVL README.md ccv.png ccvalidators_logo.png chains chains.json chains.schema.json cosmoshub_service_Governance.md cryptocrew-validators-logo.png osmosis_service_Governance.md relayers.json relayers.schema.json reports solva_logo.png update_governance_info.sh 3nnThis allows Celestia liquidity on Osmosis to be a highly attractive venue for using the token as the pool grows whilst being tempered by both the quantity of Celestia staked and in the event that the pool does not attract the intended liquidity.nn## Funding managementnnThis proposal spends the requested OSMO into a multisig on DAODAO to be loaded to the specified pool by the members according to the above criteria.nnMembers of the [multisig](https://osmosis.daodao.zone/dao/osmo1g6dsaslf2gyzf6yexgmefsf4c4kc7ddu0jh3jtpg4a7x9xxy6z9qttelz7/proposals) are:nn* CryptoCrew (Validator)n* John Galt (Stride Contributor)n* Johnny Wyles (Osmosis Labs)
