This proposal would redirect the second stage of the USDC incentive migration process to the Community pool. 
## Background 
[Proposal 648](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/648) called for incentives on the OSMO/USDC.axl pool to be moved to the newly IBC native OSMO/USDC pool in two stages. 
The second stage occurs with the [routine incentive proposal](https://www.mintscan.io/osmosis/proposals/678) for November 2023. 

This proposal asks that these incentives not be added to the OSMO/USDC pool but be redirected to the Community Pool. 

The reasoning for this is that the [OSMO/USDC Pool](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/1221) currently receives 3,213 OSMO per day, or 29% of all Incentive emissions, and yet has only attached $224k Liquidity despite high incentive rates. 

The routine incentives proposal increases this to 5,700 OSMO per day, leading to a more inefficient use of Incentive spend. 

This proposal would adjust the pool incentives as if the second migration had not been added by setting the OSMO/USDC incentives to 2,850 OSMO per day and redirecting the excess to the Community pool.
