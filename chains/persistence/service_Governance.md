# **XPRT Liquidity Bootstrapping (XLB) incentives on Dexter and Osmosis - December 2023**


## **Context**
[Persistence Proposal 21](https://www.mintscan.io/persistence/proposals/21) allocated 1M XPRT from the Ecosystem wallet to bootstrap XPRT liquidity on Dexter and Osmosis. So far, 808,700 XPRT tokens (80.87%) have been used via governance approval. 
Considering the above, this proposal suggests keeping the same incentives as the last cycle to continue steady and sustainable liquidity growth across diversified pools on Dexter. 


## **Proposal**
The next leg of XLB incentives from the [Persistence Incentivization Multisig](https://www.mintscan.io/persistence/account/persistence1zlc6d8nr2uwqym32mk7pqv2k7qjkwlcm6vfh29) in December 2023 is proposed as follows:
* Allocate 50,000 XPRT to ATOM/XPRT on Dexter for 7-day LP bonding over 30 days, starting around 9 December 2023
* Allocate 10,000 XPRT to XPRT/OSMO (Pool #1101) on Osmosis Supercharged Liquidity over 30 days, starting around 9 December 2023
* Allocate 10,000 XPRT to XPRT/USDT on Dexter for 7-day LP bonding over 30 days, starting around 9 December 2023
