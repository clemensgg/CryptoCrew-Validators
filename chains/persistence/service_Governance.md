# **XPRT Liquidity Bootstrapping (XLB) incentives on Dexter and Osmosis - November 2023**


## **Context**

Persistence Proposal 21 allocated 1M XPRT from the Ecosystem wallet to bootstrap XPRT liquidity on Dexter and Osmosis. So far, 748,700 XPRT tokens (74.87%) have been used via governance approval. In-depth insights around the use of the incentives, their efficacy, and learnings can be found in the [public XPRT Incentives Log](https://www.notion.so/persistence/XPRT-Incentives-Log-e82b48c0656242439bae3e201143fdbf?pvs=4#102f7dd5e6924637a9d3c118ac5c2c8a).

Considering the above, this proposal suggests keeping the incentives the same as the last cycle and introduce incentives for a new XPRT/USDT pool on Dexter. This suggestion is influenced by three key factors:



1. Diversifying token incentives to new pools to grow liquidity
2. Striking a balance between staking and LPing XPRT
3. Testing the waters with a 30-day period


## **Proposal**

The next leg of XLB incentives from the [Persistence Incentivization Multisig](https://www.mintscan.io/persistence/account/persistence1zlc6d8nr2uwqym32mk7pqv2k7qjkwlcm6vfh29) in November 2023 is proposed as follows:



* Allocate 50,000 XPRT to ATOM/XPRT on Dexter for 7-day LP bonding over 30 days, starting around 9 November 2023
* Allocate 10,000 XPRT to XPRT/OSMO (Pool #1101) on Osmosis Supercharged Liquidity over 30 days, starting around 13 November 2023
* Allocate 10,000 XPRT to XPRT/USDT on Dexter for 7-day LP bonding over 30 days, starting after the pool goes live
