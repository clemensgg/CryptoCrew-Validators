It includes expenses related to development resources, infrastructure and maintenance & support.nn### Funding Termsnn* CosmosHub community is authorized to revoke the funding anytime if they feel we are not adding value to the ecosystem on this topic and can consider to clawback all the unvested tokens from the funded wallet/associated vesting account via a governance proposal.n* The funding follows the following vesting criteria. We divided the vesting into two accounts as mentioned in the forum.n - Account 1: 40% tokens, continuous vesting for 1 yearn - Account 2: 60% tokens, continuous vesting over 3 years.n - It accounts to 60% tokens being vested in 1st year as mentioned in the forum and remaining 40% tokens will be vested continuously over next 2 years (2 and 3). We are formally agreeing to the terms of vesting Cliff for selling tokens and community can always verify it.n README.md ccv.png ccvalidators_logo.png chains chains.json chains.schema.json cosmoshub_service_Governance.md cryptocrew-validators-logo.png relayers.json relayers.schema.json reports solva_logo.png update_governance_info.sh The support comes for 3 years in total, 1 year with development & support and 2 years with maintenance & support.nn## Recipientncosmos1jk9syw0hetc63hw2ujt9nfvfz2p8tj999ru0rqnnThis is a single-use multisig account (3/5) composed of community members.
