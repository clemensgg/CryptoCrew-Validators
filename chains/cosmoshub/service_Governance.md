n# SummarynnThis community spend proposal is for growing ATOM liquid staking with pSTAKE‚Äôs stkATOM by allocating 600k ATOM as Cosmos Hub Protocol Owned Liquidity (stkATOM Hub POL) on Astroport (Neutron) and Dexter (Persistence). nnIn return, [pSTAKE Finance (through $PSTAKE governance) has already committed to sharing 15% of its total ATOM liquid staking revenue with the Cosmos Hub](https://snapshot.org/#/pstakefinance.eth/proposal/0xd5c574b5e89285bff2013feb03f9dd1e388485637646c9b5a4b387aba9151c05) and waive off the protocol fee (currently set at 5%) charged on liquid staking 300k ATOM out of the 600k ATOM from the community pool. The revenue share agreement will be valid for the entire duration until the Cosmos Hub provides this ‚ÄòLiquidity-as-a-Service‚Äô (LaaS) to stkATOM.nnOne can learn more about stkATOM, current stats and DeFi usage, unique features, steps taken to decentralize Cosmos Hub, and security considerations [here](https://www.notion.so/persistence/All-you-need-to-know-about-stkATOM-4fe31dc09bd8472ca2b7d7dffe654864).nn# DetailsnnThe final proposal considers feedback from four weeks of active discussions within the Cosmos Hub community.nnn1. Liquid Stake 300k ATOM (out of the 600k ATOM) with pSTAKE to mint stkATOMn2. Provide 350k ATOM worth of liquidity on a new stkATOM/ATOM pool on Astroport on Neutronn3. Provide 250k ATOM worth of liquidity on the [stkATOM/ATOM metastable pool on Dexter on Persistence](https://app.dexter.zone/pools)nnThe proposed POL is suggested to be steered by a 3/5 multisig wallet (stkATOM Hub POL Multisig - cosmos1hj2zms8g4j2npnqgzft90nhdw37tstkvksx66q) comprising the following Cosmos Ecosystem contributors:nnSpaydh - Avril Dutheil (Neutron)nClemens Scarpatetti (Cryptocrew)nSanjeev Rao (Leap Wallet)nMichael NG (Stake With Us)nMikhil Pandey (Persistence Labs)nnThe stkATOM Hub POL multisig will only liquid stake ATOM and provide stkATOM liquidity on the above-mentioned protocols. The POL will be deployed for at least one year and remain unbonded. ATOM governance can continually re-evaluate the POL‚Äôs duration, split, withdrawal, and further stkATOM Hub POL multisig actions at any time.nnThe stkATOM Hub POL multisig is expected to be a temporary solution until Timewave Labs‚Äô Covenant v2 is launched for non-custodial POL holding. Using and transferring funds to Timewave‚Äôs solution will also be subject to ATOM governance.nn# Ecosystem Value AddnnstkATOM liquidity on Astroport can contribute to Neutron‚Äôs growth through increased on-chain activity, diversified LSTfi landscape, and new revenue sources with transaction fees, and swap fees generated by this POL.nnDexter is the current liquidity base for stkATOM in Cosmos on Persistence, the app chain for LSTfi. A metastable pool combined with an ongoing Trader Rebate Program has generated ~$3.5M+ volume to date. nnThis proposed LaaS holds the power for ATOM, as a capital tool, ton- Generate revenue for the Cosmos Hubn- Strengthen itself at the centre of Cosmos LSTfin- Diversify the Community Pool‚Äôs exposure to ATOM LSTsn- Increase stkATOM (liquid staking) demand with stronger stkATOM-ATOM peg, increased LSM usage on pSTAKE, and additional collateralization opportunitiesn- Align ecosystems within and outside the ‚ÄòATOM Economic Zone‚ÄônnCosmos Hub Forum Discussion - https://forum.cosmos.network/t/final-call-allocate-600k-atom-to-pstake-for-growth-of-atom-liquid-staking/11873nn# Votingnn- By voting YES, you agree with deploying the proposed stkATOM Hub POL on Astroport (Neutron) and Dexter (Persistence) to grow ATOM liquid stakingn- By voting NO, you disagree with deploying the proposed stkATOM Hub POL on Astroport (Neutron) and Dexter (Persistence) to grow ATOM liquid stakingn- By voting ABSTAIN, you contribute to the quorum but formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.n- By voting NO WITH VETO, you consider this proposal spam, malicious, or harmful and want the depositors penalized by burning their deposit.

Due to an unforeseen relayer issue that resulted in the subject client exceeding the trusting period, the IBC client 07-tendermint-1157 used by channel-726 for ATOM transfers from Cosmoshub to Realio is currently in an expired state. If accepted, this proposal will update client 07-tendermint-1157 with the data from 07-tendermint-1189 which is created newly, so that users may continue to take advantage of both the established channels.

## SummarynProposal to request for 20000 ATOM from the community spending pool to funding the first inscription protocol (crc-20)non Cosmos.nn## DetailsnCOSSÔºàcrc-20Ôºâis designed to build an inscription system on cosmos. It will integrate trading, minting and a complete setnof functions.nnOur team believes that in order to improve the ecosystem on cosmos we need to build an inscription system. Since cosmosndoesn't support smart contract, it's a perfect fit for an inscription system to be built as a part of the existingnecosystem.nnInscriptions will dramatically increase the utilization of Atom and bring in a lot of extra gas fees, making the cosmosnchain assets more diversified. For this reason, after months of work we have created a crc-20 standard and will releasenthe first version of the system in the next few days.nn### Tasksn1. Open inscription market, minting function, indexing function, transfer functionn2. Create IBC function for inscriptions so that it can interconnect with other blockchains.n3. Use the funding provided on other cosmos chains to provide liquidity for inscription tokens.n4. Achieve complete decentralization of the inscription system and explore the possibility of using inscription innconjunction with ICS.n5. Explore more possibilities for inscriptions.nn50% of the funding will be used to complete the development and maintenance of the above tasks.nThe other 50% will be used to improve the ecosystem and provide liquidity for the inscription tokens.nnRegardless of whether or not the proposal passes, we will do our best to promote the development of the inscriptionnecosystem at Cosmos.nn## Forum post linknhttps://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-funding-the-first-inscription-coss-on-cosmos/12317nn## IPFS pin of proposal on-forumnhttps://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTkzDwWqPbnAh5YiV5VwcTLnGdwSNsNTn2aDxdXBFca7D/example#/ipfs/QmZ4NWg9Xy379vU6me4wRTyEjJmHB3BzXWX9opciRsS2gWnn## Recipientncosmos1r9759z2qa4yaajk85d95y2kfmhs277uh3efv2ann## Amountn20000 ATOMnn## Governance VotesnThe following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this proposal:nnYES - You approve this community spend proposal to deposit 20000 ATOM to the team to build the Cosmos inscription.nnNO - You disapprove of this community spend proposal in its current form.nnNO WITH VETO - You are strongly opposed to this change and will exit the network if passed.nnABSTAIN - You are impartial to the outcome of the proposal.nn## Websitenhttps://coss.inknn## Twitternhttps://twitter.com/coss_market
