The Cosmos Hub community has explicitly signalled that the growth of liquid staked Atom is a key initiative for the ecosystem. Since [prop 800](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/800), executed on June 28th, 2023, the Cosmos Hub has provisioned 450k ATOM of liquidity for liquid staked Atom. With the recent release of the LSM in [Prop 821](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/821), native staked atom is now able to become liquid staked, without waiting 2 weeks. This has caused a surge of liquid staked atom, and the community pool should now double down on its investment in bolstering stability of the staked atom peg and protocol revenue from enabling this.nnTo recap, the reasons for the community pool adding more liquidity to Atom/stATOM is:n* DeFi Collateral Assetn README.md ccv.png ccvalidators_logo.png chains chains.json chains.schema.json cosmoshub_service_Governance.md cryptocrew-validators-logo.png relayers.json relayers.schema.json reports solva_logo.png update_governance_info.sh ATOM DeFi requires markets (Lending, Perps, Stablecoins) that enable stATOM as collateraln README.md ccv.png ccvalidators_logo.png chains chains.json chains.schema.json cosmoshub_service_Governance.md cryptocrew-validators-logo.png relayers.json relayers.schema.json reports solva_logo.png update_governance_info.sh The high ATOM staking APY means that lending Atom is uncompetitive and lending markets need liquid staked Atomn README.md ccv.png ccvalidators_logo.png chains chains.json chains.schema.json cosmoshub_service_Governance.md cryptocrew-validators-logo.png relayers.json relayers.schema.json reports solva_logo.png update_governance_info.sh Most on-chain liquidity is against Atom, and therefore lending markets must be able to liquidate stATOM for ATOM.n* Protocol Revenuen README.md ccv.png ccvalidators_logo.png chains chains.json chains.schema.json cosmoshub_service_Governance.md cryptocrew-validators-logo.png relayers.json relayers.schema.json reports solva_logo.png update_governance_info.sh LP'ing gives the community pool revenue based on swap fees.

Given that stATOM has grown since [prop 800](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/800), and is expected to continue, we suggest increasing the Cosmos Hub community pool's stATOM/ATOM position here by a factor 3. This translates to adding in 900k ATOM into ATOM/stATOM liquidity, bringing the percentage of stATOM backstopped by the community pool to a bit under 33% of all stATOM currently minted. Furthermore, as explained in the Mechanics section, we suggest using concentrated liquidity positions for this, making this liquidity >15x times more effective than what has been provisioned to date.nn## Why Osmosis for provisioning this liquidity?nnOsmosis remains very clearly the hub of user activity and defi volumes in Cosmos, and is obviously central to the ATOM Economy. It is the center of on-chain ATOM volumes and the main driver of ATOM usage in DeFi. If ATOM is to be Interchain money, Osmosis is the place to be.nnAs ATOM LSDs are a key part of ATOM's moneyness play, it is key to drive alignment and liquidity on Osmosis.nnnOsmosis's concentrated liquidity pools are the optimal place for the Cosmos Hub to deploy ATOM/stATOM Protocol Owned Liquidity for a variety of reasons:nn- Osmosis has done $459k of stATOM volumes over the last week. This is 22x the stATOM volumes that Neutron did over the last week (~$20k), where current POL is deployed. ([data reference](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JXuz4BLCkpkGSp3Vilv8_eQuTT8r4vk22Qa3eCfpPAo/edit?usp=sharing))n - The Cosmos Hub will earn far more protocol revenue on its provisioned ATOM on Osmosis through trading fees due to the far greater volumesnn- Osmosis is used as the liquidation venue for most major Cosmos DeFi apps both on-Osmosis (i.e. Mars, Levana, Membrane, etc) and off-Osmosis (i.e. IST, Umee, Nolus, etc)n - Increased liquidity helps increase the usage of stATOM as the collateral SOV of choice, as higher liquidity enables higher deposit caps.n- Is more capital efficient than alternativesn - Due to usage of Supercharged Liquidity, within the single, simple static range proposed in the Mechanics section, we are 15x more effective than simple CFMM's such as astroportn - With the usage of already live, dynamic Quasar vaults (which don't exist on alternatives like Neutron), the capital efficiency can exceed 100x more than alternatives.n- stATOM liquidity on Osmosis will make it easier to use stATOM for gas fees on Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, and other chains that use fee-abstractionn - This will increase ATOM's moneyness throughout the Cosmos ecosystemnnnThus building deep liquidity for ATOM LSDs on Osmosis is pivotal to the success of Cosmos DeFi and ATOM as one of its core SOV assets. The ATOM Economic Zone must extend anywhere ATOM can be used for security OR as money.nnn## MechanicsnnWe propose putting 90% of this amount in a a static liquidity position of stATOM/ATOM `[1.0, 1.35]`[^2]. This liquidity will be far more beneficial to the ecosystem due to its capital efficiency enabled by Osmosis's supercharged liquidity. With the suggested static range, the liquidity will be >15x as efficient as it would be on a classical AMM like Astroport.nnWe also propose that the other 10% be provisioned into the upcoming stATOM/ATOM Dynamic S+ vault on Quasar, which will use a dynamic liquidity provisioning strategy with data provided by Define Logic Labs, one of the data science firms behind the Real Yield strategies on Sommelier.nnIn a LSD liquidity pool, most liquidity above the redemption rate is effectively wasted, as a buyer of stATOM would be better off minting stATOM than buying above the redemption rate. However, managing liquidity to track the dynamic redemption rate is a challenge, especially for a DAO. Thus, by leveraging a dynamic vault like Quasar's, the Hub's ATOM liquidity provision will be even more effective. Over time, as Quasar and other vault providers prove themselves, a higher percent of the liquidity should be provisioned into the them, as directed by Hub governance. As currently Quasar is the only vault provider with a CL vault live, we are suggesting them to start with.nnThe funds will be custodied by a 3/5 multisig account `cosmos1lq0gyl7eh4k8wm8ycdsqh7mrsawc8tp3nf2kzy` consisting of:nn- [Zaki Manian, Iqlusion](https://twitter.com/zmanian)n- [Valentin Pletnev, Quasar](https://twitter.com/valeyo777)n- [Joni Z, AADao](https://twitter.com/Curious__J)n- [Masha, Everstake](https://twitter.com/Everstake_Masha)n- [Johnny Wyles, Osmosis](https://twitter.com/JohnnyWyles87)

### üó≥ 860: Signaling Proposal - Claw back unvested funds from Proposal 104
- Voting Start: Wed Dec 06 2023 23:13:40 UTC

In Proposal 104, approved on 1 March 2023, Notional was granted 120,000 ATOMs to monitor the Cosmos Hub for security vulnerabilities 365/24/7. The exact on-chain proposal can be found at [here](https://inbloc.org/proposal/104)

This proposal is a signalling proposal to reclaim the unvested (i.e. still locked) funds in the multisig. At the time of this proposal, the amount that is unvested is just over 90,000 Atom. The address of the multisig is [cosmos145hytrc49m0hn6fphp8d5h4xspwkawcuzmx498](https://cosmos.explorers.guru/account/cosmos145hytrc49m0hn6fphp8d5h4xspwkawcuzmx498).

### üó≥ 861: Increase Active Set of Validators from 180 to 190

There is currently >700k ATOM sitting just outside of the active set of 180 validators (not including jailed validators). Increasing the active set from 180 to 190 would allow all of this stake to participate in consensus, further decentralizing Cosmos Hub. Additionally, all validators that would be added to the active set should be profitable, incentivizing them to perform properly and add to the security of Cosmos Hub. For those worried about this change decreasing your rewards, an additional 2,000,000 ATOM in the active set would change the APY from 13.98% to 13.86% (and there will be far less than 2,000,000 ATOM added), so any decrease in rewards will be relatively insignificant.

This governance proposal addresses the urgent need for supporting IBC relayers on the Cosmos Hub following the recent gas fee increase.nnIt proposes the establishment of a fee-grant support system, funded by the community, to cover gas fees for IBC relaying activities. The proposal outlines the critical role of relayers in maintaining the network's interoperability and the negative impact of increased operational costs on their sustainability. The proposing team consisting of respected Cosmos Hub relayers suggests forming a multisig group to manage the distribution of fee-grants to vetted relayers, offering a temporary solution to prevent service degradation and ensure the continuity of efficient IBC operations on the Cosmos Hub.nnThis proposal, which has been created in collaboration by various relayer teams, including Lavender Five, CryptoCrew, Crosnest, Cosmos Spaces, Architect Nodes and IcyCRO, is seeking 8,000 ATOM (3x 2000 + Safety margin) to be send to a ‚Öó multisig (`cosmos14r8ff03jkyac2fukjtfrfgaj8ehjlhds5ec2zp`) to cover ATOM gas fees for IBC relaying to and from the Cosmos Hub for a period of 3 months.nnThe signers of the multisig are:nn- Clemens (CryptoCrew): `cosmos1705swa2kgn9pvancafzl254f63a3jda9ngdnc7`n- Ghazni (StakeCito): `cosmos1qm5agp78atuf9pyalsq4w30mzc3lxtj0vgq2qe`n- luisqa (Interbloc): `cosmos1ze09kc5ackut7wc4pf38lysu45kfz3ms86w3em`n- tricky (CosmosSpaces): `cosmos1a8x3fn37gjnglcr25fsfyr6c5m4ed5euwvae2n`n- Ertemann (Lavender.Five Nodes): `cosmos1xfl6qve3plepgk7wlgxypem5ngntavrnkng3vz`nnOne can read about the chosen onboarding requirements on the respective forum post: [https://forum.cosmos.network/t/last-call-cosmos-hub-ibc-relayer-gas-cost-restitution-plan-feegrants/12225](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/last-call-cosmos-hub-ibc-relayer-gas-cost-restitution-plan-feegrants/12225).nnThe post also contains further information about the problem at hand and an FAQ.
