## Vitwit's Funding Proposal: Support Resolutenn**[Resolute](https://resolute.vitwit.com/)** is an [opensource](https://github.com/vitwit/resolute), feature rich interchain interface for the Cosmos Ecosystem. The main objective of this project is to become a single place for interacting with any appchain that uses the cosmos stack.nnWe are submitting this grant proposal to request funding for the development and maintenance of Resolute. All the work we have been doing for Resolute is self funded so far since May, 2022. We believe we pushed these developments for a usable tool for the ecosystem and believe we are eligible for the community funding.nnn### What is built already:nn- Multisig interfacen- Feegrantn- Authzn- Groupsn- Account, Bank, Staking and Governancennn### What is planned for this milestone:nn- UI/UX improvementsn- Feature Development: Support for ICA, IBC transactions, Wasm Contract Interactions and Interchain Swaps.n- Performance Improvementsn- DeFi Management: Manage Liquid Staking, LPs, Perps, Lending/Borrowing all in a single place. It connects multiple DeFi apps from Osmosis, Neutron (scope), LS on Stride, Quicksilver.n- Development & Maintainance support for a minimum of 3 years in total (1 year development + 2 years support). This includes fixing bugs, improving performance, adding new message types for existing features as they're developed etc.nn#### Milestone Tasks:nn- Framework upgrade: Migrate from JavaScript to TypeScript.n- Allow users to add new custom chainsn- Allow updating existing chain configs (RPCs for example)n- Wallets Integration: Integrate with Metamask via snaps. It already has support for Keplr, Leap and Cosmostation wallets.n- Add support for more message types in multisig, authz and groups page.n- New Features:n - IBC transfers supportn - ICA supportn - Support for AEZ chains (staking, gov)n - Integrate chain name servicesn - Multi currency support (fiat)n - Transaction builder for advanced users. It will allow users to build transaction by appending multiple messages, also allows users to upload csv sheet for building transactions.n - Scheduled transactions. Allow users to schedule transactions (Subjected to security review from community builders).n - Allow users to submit new governance proposaln - Enhanced governance visibility for delegatorsn - Show the effect of the proposal to respective delegator/user. Like in case of paramchange proposals.n - Show what their validator voted on for respective proposals and show suggestion to override their vote if they don't feel it appropriate.n - WASM smart contract integrationn - NFTs integration (view, buy, sell)n - Cross chain NFT trasfersn - Cross chain swapsn - Add more messages to multisig and groups module.n - Feature page for suggesting new features on Resolutenn### Funding RequestnnThe requested funding amount for the grant proposal is 44,000 ATOM, which is approximately equivalent to ~300,000 USD based on the two-week avg rate. It includes expenses related to development resources, infrastructure and maintenance & support.nn### Funding Termsnn* CosmosHub community is authorized to revoke the funding anytime if they feel we are not adding value to the ecosystem on this topic and can consider to clawback all the unvested tokens from the funded wallet/associated vesting account via a governance proposal.n* The funding follows the following vesting criteria. We divided the vesting into two accounts as mentioned in the forum.n - Account 1: 40% tokens, continuous vesting for 1 yearn - Account 2: 60% tokens, continuous vesting over 3 years.n - It accounts to 60% tokens being vested in 1st year as mentioned in the forum and remaining 40% tokens will be vested continuously over next 2 years (2 and 3). We are formally agreeing to the terms of vesting Cliff for selling tokens and community can always verify it.n README.md ccv.png ccvalidators_logo.png chains chains.json chains.schema.json cosmoshub_service_Governance.md cryptocrew-validators-logo.png relayers.json relayers.schema.json reports solva_logo.png update_governance_info.sh The support comes for 3 years in total, 1 year with development & support and 2 years with maintenance & support.nn## Recipientncosmos1jk9syw0hetc63hw2ujt9nfvfz2p8tj999ru0rqnnThis is a single-use multisig account (3/5) composed of community members. Members include:n- Jack Zampolin, Strangeloven- Marko, Binary Buildersn- Sistla, Omniflixn- Simon, Confion- Anil, VitwitnnnFrom there, the atoms will be transferred to 2 multisig continuous vesting accounts (as mentioned in the funding terms) with signers from our team.nn## Amountn44,000 ATOM (based on 2 weeks average price data).nn## Forum post linknhttps://forum.cosmos.network/t/vitwits-funding-proposal-supporting-public-goods-resolute/11580nnn## Governance votesnThe following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this proposal:n* YES: Approve the grant proposaln* ABSTAIN - You wish to contribute to quorum but you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.n* NO: Reject the grant proposaln* NO WITH VETO - A 'NoWithVeto' vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.n

# SummaryrnrnThis is a proposal to fund a core development and testing package on the Cosmos Hub for 2024.

The total budget is $5.7 million USD (to be held in 30% ATOM, 70% USDC), plus 100k ATOM in performance bonuses, for a total of 914,285.71 using a spot price of 7 USD. This funding would replace both teams‚Äô current funding from the Interchain Foundation and have these teams be directly accountable to the community. As of October 26, 2023, this represents approximately 18% of the community pool. rnrn**Notes:** rn - ATOM values have been calculated using a spot price of $7 USD as of October 26, 2023.rn - This budget only covers the teams at Hypha and Informal that work specifically on the Cosmos Hub. rn - The ATOM total requested from the community pool includes a 25% buffer on the budget amount to cover fluctuation in ATOM price over the 2-week voting period. Any unused buffer will be returned to the community pool.rnrn**This proposal is summarized by the following propositions:**rnrn(1) The release of 1,117,857.14 ATOM to finance:rn - An overall budget of $5.7M USD plus 100k ATOM in possible performance bonuses, with a 25% buffer to cover price fluctuations between start of voting and liquidation to USDC.

The liquidation multisig is made of:rn - Simply Stakingrn - Stakecitorn - Citadel Onern - CryptoCrewrn - Stakinrnrn(3) The ratification of a committee that will oversee the work of Informal and Hypha within the time period of January 1, 2024 - December 31, 2024 and provide insight and visibility to the community about that work. The committee is made of:rn - Stride contributor: Aidan Salzmannrn - Neutron contributor: Avril Dutheilrn - Polkachu representative: Polkachurn - Jim Parillo at Figment Capitalrn - Shane Vitarana at Stargazern - James Hinck, Product Manager at Circle rn rn(4) An optimistic vesting mechanism which gives the community the power to suspend either team‚Äôs work agreement at any time via a governance proposal if that team is not fulfilling their commitment to the Hubrnrn(5) Detailed disbursal of funds as follows:rn - **Informal budget:** 3.16M USDC + $1.34M worth of ATOMrn - **Informal bonus:** 79k ATOMrn - **Hypha budget:** 840k USDC + $340k worth of ATOMrn - **Hypha bonus:** 21k ATOMrn - Of the budget portions, any unused funds will be returned on a quarterly basis.rn - Any unearned bonuses will be returned on a quarterly basis.
