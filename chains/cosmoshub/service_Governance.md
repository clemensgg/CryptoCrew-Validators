## SummarynProposal to request for 20000 ATOM from the community spending pool to funding the first inscription protocol (crc-20)non Cosmos.nn## DetailsnCOSSÔºàcrc-20Ôºâis designed to build an inscription system on cosmos. It will integrate trading, minting and a complete setnof functions.nnOur team believes that in order to improve the ecosystem on cosmos we need to build an inscription system. Since cosmosndoesn't support smart contract, it's a perfect fit for an inscription system to be built as a part of the existingnecosystem.nnInscriptions will dramatically increase the utilization of Atom and bring in a lot of extra gas fees, making the cosmosnchain assets more diversified. For this reason, after months of work we have created a crc-20 standard and will releasenthe first version of the system in the next few days.nn### Tasksn1. Open inscription market, minting function, indexing function, transfer functionn2. Create IBC function for inscriptions so that it can interconnect with other blockchains.n3. Use the funding provided on other cosmos chains to provide liquidity for inscription tokens.n4. Achieve complete decentralization of the inscription system and explore the possibility of using inscription innconjunction with ICS.n5. Explore more possibilities for inscriptions.nn50% of the funding will be used to complete the development and maintenance of the above tasks.nThe other 50% will be used to improve the ecosystem and provide liquidity for the inscription tokens.nnRegardless of whether or not the proposal passes, we will do our best to promote the development of the inscriptionnecosystem at Cosmos.nn## Forum post linknhttps://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-funding-the-first-inscription-coss-on-cosmos/12317nn## IPFS pin of proposal on-forumnhttps://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTkzDwWqPbnAh5YiV5VwcTLnGdwSNsNTn2aDxdXBFca7D/example#/ipfs/QmZ4NWg9Xy379vU6me4wRTyEjJmHB3BzXWX9opciRsS2gWnn## Recipientncosmos1r9759z2qa4yaajk85d95y2kfmhs277uh3efv2ann## Amountn20000 ATOMnn## Governance VotesnThe following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this proposal:nnYES - You approve this community spend proposal to deposit 20000 ATOM to the team to build the Cosmos inscription.nnNO - You disapprove of this community spend proposal in its current form.nnNO WITH VETO - You are strongly opposed to this change and will exit the network if passed.nnABSTAIN - You are impartial to the outcome of the proposal.nn## Websitenhttps://coss.inknn## Twitternhttps://twitter.com/coss_market

The Cosmos Hub community has explicitly signalled that the growth of liquid staked Atom is a key initiative for the ecosystem. Since [prop 800](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/800), executed on June 28th, 2023, the Cosmos Hub has provisioned 450k ATOM of liquidity for liquid staked Atom. With the recent release of the LSM in [Prop 821](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/821), native staked atom is now able to become liquid staked, without waiting 2 weeks. This has caused a surge of liquid staked atom, and the community pool should now double down on its investment in bolstering stability of the staked atom peg and protocol revenue from enabling this.nnTo recap, the reasons for the community pool adding more liquidity to Atom/stATOM is:n* DeFi Collateral Assetn README.md ccv.png ccvalidators_logo.png chains chains.json chains.schema.json cosmoshub_service_Governance.md cryptocrew-validators-logo.png relayers.json relayers.schema.json reports solva_logo.png update_governance_info.sh ATOM DeFi requires markets (Lending, Perps, Stablecoins) that enable stATOM as collateraln README.md ccv.png ccvalidators_logo.png chains chains.json chains.schema.json cosmoshub_service_Governance.md cryptocrew-validators-logo.png relayers.json relayers.schema.json reports solva_logo.png update_governance_info.sh The high ATOM staking APY means that lending Atom is uncompetitive and lending markets need liquid staked Atomn README.md ccv.png ccvalidators_logo.png chains chains.json chains.schema.json cosmoshub_service_Governance.md cryptocrew-validators-logo.png relayers.json relayers.schema.json reports solva_logo.png update_governance_info.sh Most on-chain liquidity is against Atom, and therefore lending markets must be able to liquidate stATOM for ATOM.n* Protocol Revenuen README.md ccv.png ccvalidators_logo.png chains chains.json chains.schema.json cosmoshub_service_Governance.md cryptocrew-validators-logo.png relayers.json relayers.schema.json reports solva_logo.png update_governance_info.sh LP'ing gives the community pool revenue based on swap fees.

Given that stATOM has grown since [prop 800](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/800), and is expected to continue, we suggest increasing the Cosmos Hub community pool's stATOM/ATOM position here by a factor 3. This translates to adding in 900k ATOM into ATOM/stATOM liquidity, bringing the percentage of stATOM backstopped by the community pool to a bit under 33% of all stATOM currently minted. Furthermore, as explained in the Mechanics section, we suggest using concentrated liquidity positions for this, making this liquidity >15x times more effective than what has been provisioned to date.nn## Why Osmosis for provisioning this liquidity?nnOsmosis remains very clearly the hub of user activity and defi volumes in Cosmos, and is obviously central to the ATOM Economy. It is the center of on-chain ATOM volumes and the main driver of ATOM usage in DeFi. If ATOM is to be Interchain money, Osmosis is the place to be.nnAs ATOM LSDs are a key part of ATOM's moneyness play, it is key to drive alignment and liquidity on Osmosis.nnnOsmosis's concentrated liquidity pools are the optimal place for the Cosmos Hub to deploy ATOM/stATOM Protocol Owned Liquidity for a variety of reasons:nn- Osmosis has done $459k of stATOM volumes over the last week. This is 22x the stATOM volumes that Neutron did over the last week (~$20k), where current POL is deployed. ([data reference](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JXuz4BLCkpkGSp3Vilv8_eQuTT8r4vk22Qa3eCfpPAo/edit?usp=sharing))n - The Cosmos Hub will earn far more protocol revenue on its provisioned ATOM on Osmosis through trading fees due to the far greater volumesnn- Osmosis is used as the liquidation venue for most major Cosmos DeFi apps both on-Osmosis (i.e. Mars, Levana, Membrane, etc) and off-Osmosis (i.e. IST, Umee, Nolus, etc)n - Increased liquidity helps increase the usage of stATOM as the collateral SOV of choice, as higher liquidity enables higher deposit caps.n- Is more capital efficient than alternativesn - Due to usage of Supercharged Liquidity, within the single, simple static range proposed in the Mechanics section, we are 15x more effective than simple CFMM's such as astroportn - With the usage of already live, dynamic Quasar vaults (which don't exist on alternatives like Neutron), the capital efficiency can exceed 100x more than alternatives.n- stATOM liquidity on Osmosis will make it easier to use stATOM for gas fees on Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, and other chains that use fee-abstractionn - This will increase ATOM's moneyness throughout the Cosmos ecosystemnnnThus building deep liquidity for ATOM LSDs on Osmosis is pivotal to the success of Cosmos DeFi and ATOM as one of its core SOV assets. The ATOM Economic Zone must extend anywhere ATOM can be used for security OR as money.nnn## MechanicsnnWe propose putting 90% of this amount in a a static liquidity position of stATOM/ATOM `[1.0, 1.35]`[^2]. This liquidity will be far more beneficial to the ecosystem due to its capital efficiency enabled by Osmosis's supercharged liquidity. With the suggested static range, the liquidity will be >15x as efficient as it would be on a classical AMM like Astroport.nnWe also propose that the other 10% be provisioned into the upcoming stATOM/ATOM Dynamic S+ vault on Quasar, which will use a dynamic liquidity provisioning strategy with data provided by Define Logic Labs, one of the data science firms behind the Real Yield strategies on Sommelier.nnIn a LSD liquidity pool, most liquidity above the redemption rate is effectively wasted, as a buyer of stATOM would be better off minting stATOM than buying above the redemption rate. However, managing liquidity to track the dynamic redemption rate is a challenge, especially for a DAO. Thus, by leveraging a dynamic vault like Quasar's, the Hub's ATOM liquidity provision will be even more effective. Over time, as Quasar and other vault providers prove themselves, a higher percent of the liquidity should be provisioned into the them, as directed by Hub governance. As currently Quasar is the only vault provider with a CL vault live, we are suggesting them to start with.nnThe funds will be custodied by a 3/5 multisig account `cosmos1lq0gyl7eh4k8wm8ycdsqh7mrsawc8tp3nf2kzy` consisting of:nn- [Zaki Manian, Iqlusion](https://twitter.com/zmanian)n- [Valentin Pletnev, Quasar](https://twitter.com/valeyo777)n- [Joni Z, AADao](https://twitter.com/Curious__J)n- [Masha, Everstake](https://twitter.com/Everstake_Masha)n- [Johnny Wyles, Osmosis](https://twitter.com/JohnnyWyles87)

<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
In Proposal 104, approved on 1 March 2023, Notional was granted 120,000 ATOMs to monitor the Cosmos Hub for security vulnerabilities 365/24/7. The exact on-chain proposal can be found at [here](https://inbloc.org/proposal/104)

This proposal is a signalling proposal to reclaim the unvested (i.e. still locked) funds in the multisig. At the time of this proposal, the amount that is unvested is just over 90,000 Atom. The address of the multisig is [cosmos145hytrc49m0hn6fphp8d5h4xspwkawcuzmx498](https://cosmos.explorers.guru/account/cosmos145hytrc49m0hn6fphp8d5h4xspwkawcuzmx498).

### üó≥ 861: Increase Active Set of Validators from 180 to 190

<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
There is currently >700k ATOM sitting just outside of the active set of 180 validators (not including jailed validators). Increasing the active set from 180 to 190 would allow all of this stake to participate in consensus, further decentralizing Cosmos Hub. Additionally, all validators that would be added to the active set should be profitable, incentivizing them to perform properly and add to the security of Cosmos Hub. For those worried about this change decreasing your rewards, an additional 2,000,000 ATOM in the active set would change the APY from 13.98% to 13.86% (and there will be far less than 2,000,000 ATOM added), so any decrease in rewards will be relatively insignificant.
