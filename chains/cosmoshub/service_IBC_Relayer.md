## CryptoCrew IBC relayer
IBC relayers play a crucial role in the interchain by efficiently managing and transmitting data and assets between different blockchain networks using the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol.

To facilitate interchain message transfers, CryptoCrew utilizes the following IBC relayer software: 
- <a href="https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes"><code>hermes (ibc-rust)</code></a> relayer by [Informal Systems](https://github.com/informalsystems)
- <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/relayer"><code>rly (ibc-go)</code></a> relayer by [Strangelove Ventures](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures)
