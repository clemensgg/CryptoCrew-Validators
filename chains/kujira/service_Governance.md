Code ID 158 is an experimental BOW strategy built by the Kujira team, specifially designed to provide the best trading experience between tokens and their liquid staked versions. It will allow LPers to provide liquidity for staked token holders to instantly swap into the underlying asset, accruing a small fee. The strategy is currently running on the ampKUJI/KUJI FIN pair on testnet, and the next phase is to run in a live trading environment before opening for wider use.
