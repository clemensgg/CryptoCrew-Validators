This would reduce the total supply of GRAV and in particular the liquid supply of GRAV, and the expected effect would be an increase in the relative value of GRAV over time.

This fee would be sent to the Community Pool on any successful bid.n The minimum bid fee is a parameter the community can use to prevent spam submission to the Auction module and also to prevent minor bid competition (e.g. increasing the current bid amount by a mere 1 ugraviton every block).
