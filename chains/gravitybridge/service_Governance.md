<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
This proposal connects the ARCH token from Archway to the Gravity Bridge. If accepted, it would establish metadata for the IBC denom ibc/E05A4DAEA5681A09067DC213F32464639D18007215C87964EC45FF876B5EE82B. This metadata would then be usable to deploy an ERC20 representation on Ethereum for the ARCH token. Voters should verify that the ibc hash is on channel-145, that this channel matches the forwarding proposal submitted at the same time, and that the denom trace is for the correct token. This can be done using `gravity query ibc-transfer denom-trace ibc/E05A4DAEA5681A09067DC213F32464639D18007215C87964EC45FF876B5EE82B`
