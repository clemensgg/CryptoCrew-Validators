<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
This proposal connects the MEME token from MEME Network to the Gravity Bridge. If accepted, it would establish metadata for the IBC denom ibc/0EB6D5E44D1587D12E222C1155181884098202F56263795259C53536D07C2E65. This metadata would then be usable to deploy an ERC20 representation on Ethereum for the MEME token. Voters should verify that the ibc hash is on channel-149, that this channel matches the forwarding proposal submitted at the same time, and that the denom trace is for the correct token. This can be done using gravity query ibc-transfer denom-trace ibc/0EB6D5E44D1587D12E222C1155181884098202F56263795259C53536D07C2E65. nn For more about MEME Network see https://commonwealth.im/gravity-bridge/discussion/13611-meme-network-proposal-for-gravity-bridge and https://memenetwork.io
