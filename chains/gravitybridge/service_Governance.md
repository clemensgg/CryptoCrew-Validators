 #Overview n A Gravity-Bridge community member by the name of [Nathan Kirkland](https://github.com/kadenzipfel/smart-contract-vulnerabilities/blob/master/vulnerabilities/signature-malleability.md) detected a signature malleability vulnerability that would allow a validator to potentially perform a denial of service attack on the chain. A validator could submit a malleable mirror signature and have it accepted into the chain, but it would not be accepted as valid by either the relayer or Ethereum itself. n #Context n Following the discovery of this vulnerability, a member of the Gravty Bridge team released a patch and it was tested by a group of validators. The patch was successful and the vulnerability was resolved. n #Payment n Considering the nature of the severity and the potential economic harm it could've done we deem it appropriate to reward the finder of the bug with 1M $GRAVITON tokens ~1700 $USD.
