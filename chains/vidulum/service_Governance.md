<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
This proposal aims to adjust the 'maxValidators' parameter in the 'Staking' module from its current setting to 40. The maximum validators allowed in the active set are critical for the security of consensus on the Vidulum blockchain. Currently, there are 37 validators in the active set. If this proposal passes, no validator operators will be kicked out of the active set. We encourage the Vidulum community to discuss the potential impacts of this change and participate in the voting process.
