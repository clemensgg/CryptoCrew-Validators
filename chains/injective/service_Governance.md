<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
In collaboration with Kava, the Injective Labs team proposes launching 4 new markets (KAVA/USDT, USDTkv/USDT, BTC/USDTkv Perp, and ETH/USDTkv Perp), in addition to adding KAVA rewards to the Open Liquidity Program for the new perp markets to incentivize adoption of Cosmos native USDT (USDTkv) on Injective.

More details on OLP KAVA rewards to come.

By voting YES on this proposal, you support launching the 4 markets described above.

By voting NO on the proposal, you do not support launching the 4 markets described above.

By voting NO WITH VETO, you find this proposal to (1) be spam, i.e., irrelevant to the Injective ecosystem, (2) disproportionately infringe on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Injective governance. If the number of ‚ÄòNoWithVeto‚Äô votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the 500 INJ deposit is burned.

<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
To capture the attention of new and existing traders on Injective, the Injective Labs team proposes listing a pre-launch expiry futures market for TIA (Celestia). The market is currently set to expire on Nov 30, 2023.

The oracle price will initially be calculated based on an 8 hour exponentially weighted moving average of the last traded prices taken each minute of the last day. When TIA officially launches, the oracle price will be set to the spot price so that upon expiry/settlement, the market converges upon the spot price.

By voting YES on this proposal, you support launching the market described above.

By voting NO on the proposal, you do not support launching the market described above.

By voting NO WITH VETO, you find this proposal to (1) be spam, i.e., irrelevant to the Injective ecosystem, (2) disproportionately infringe on minority interests, or (3) violate or encourage violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Injective governance. If the number of ‚ÄòNoWithVeto‚Äô votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the 500 INJ deposit is burned.
