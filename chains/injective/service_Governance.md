<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
This proposal, if passed, will allow a new price feed oracle to be integrated with Injective, the oracle will be maintained by an external party.

As was the case for IIP-118, new proposals will be submitted for additional price feed oracles to be integrated from the same source in the future.

Passing this proposal will enable the community to list new perpetual markets on Injective exchange dApps.
