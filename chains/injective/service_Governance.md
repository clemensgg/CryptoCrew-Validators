<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
This proposal pertains to products on Injective exchange dApps.

Specifically, this proposal seeks to update the hourly funding rate limit from 0.00625% to 0.0625%.

A low funding rate was introduced in proposal 126 for a better traders experience. Since the following markets‚Äô liquidity have significantly improved since then, this proposal, if passed, updates the funding rate to a higher level. The perpetual markets to be updated are: BTC/USDT PERP, ETH/USDT PERP, INJ/USDT PERP, ATOM/USDT PERP, BNB/USDT PERP and SOL/USDT PERP.

- By voting YES on this proposal, you agree to increase the funding rate limit for six perpetual markets.

- By voting NO on the proposal, you do not support increasing the funding rate limit for six perpetual markets.

- By voting NO WITH VETO, you find this proposal to be (1) spam, i.e., irrelevant to the Injective ecosystem, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Injective governance. If the number of ‚ÄòNoWithVeto‚Äô votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the 500 INJ deposit is burned.

- By voting ABSTAIN, you wish to contribute to quorum while formally declining to vote either for or against the proposal.
