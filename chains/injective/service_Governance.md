<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
To capture the attention of new and existing traders on Injective, the Injective Labs team proposes listing a pre-launch expiry futures market for TIA (Celestia). The market is currently set to expire on Nov 30, 2023. The oracle price will initially be calculated based on an 8 hour exponentially weighted moving average of the last traded prices taken each minute of the last day. When TIA officially launches, the oracle price will be set to the spot price so that upon expiry/settlement, the market converges upon the spot price.

By voting YES on this proposal, you support launching the market described above.

By voting NO on the proposal, you do not support launching the market described above.

By voting NO WITH VETO, you find this proposal to (1) be spam, i.e., irrelevant to the Injective ecosystem, (2) disproportionately infringe on minority interests, or (3) violate or encourage violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Injective governance. If the number of ‚ÄòNoWithVeto‚Äô votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the 500 INJ deposit is burned.

By voting ABSTAIN, you wish to contribute to quorum but formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.

This proposal, if passed, will adjust the Trade & Earn reward points for the epoch that ended on October 4.

The reward points for the following addresses will be adjusted to zero:

The community has presented evidence that these addresses have unfairly received Trade & Earn rewards through malicious behavior.
