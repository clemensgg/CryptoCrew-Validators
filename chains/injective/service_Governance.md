<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
In collaboration with Kava, the Injective Labs team proposes launching 4 new markets (KAVA/USDT, USDTkv/USDT, BTC/USDTkv Perp, and ETH/USDTkv Perp), in addition to adding KAVA rewards to the Open Liquidity Program for the new perp markets to incentivize adoption of Cosmos native USDT (USDTkv) on Injective.

More details on OLP KAVA rewards to come.

By voting YES on this proposal, you support launching the 4 markets described above.

By voting NO on the proposal, you do not support launching the 4 markets described above.

By voting NO WITH VETO, you find this proposal to (1) be spam, i.e., irrelevant to the Injective ecosystem, (2) disproportionately infringe on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Injective governance. If the number of ‚ÄòNoWithVeto‚Äô votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the 500 INJ deposit is burned.

<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
To capture the attention of new and existing traders on Injective, the Injective Labs team proposes listing a pre-launch expiry futures market for TIA (Celestia). The market is currently set to expire on Nov 30, 2023.

The oracle price will initially be calculated based on an 8 hour exponentially weighted moving average of the last traded prices taken each minute of the last day. When TIA officially launches, the oracle price will be set to the spot price so that upon expiry/settlement, the market converges upon the spot price.

By voting YES on this proposal, you support launching the market described above.

By voting NO on the proposal, you do not support launching the market described above.

By voting NO WITH VETO, you find this proposal to (1) be spam, i.e., irrelevant to the Injective ecosystem, (2) disproportionately infringe on minority interests, or (3) violate or encourage violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Injective governance. If the number of ‚ÄòNoWithVeto‚Äô votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the 500 INJ deposit is burned.

This proposal, if passed, will adjust the Trade & Earn reward points for the epoch that ended on September 20.

The reward points for the following addresses will be adjusted to zero:

inj1un0lspqv2xsqcglvgn079n687zrdetrhwmxf0n

inj1eyv54halagn80kn22np3wu04deej85t8gafsuq

inj1l8qvl8hzujqkl2m4cfs6k9hgxvzu8ularqrx8w

inj1mqykgk8glnfevlu7xl0equkaq77djzm2n0g3zp

The community has presented evidence that these addresses have unfairly received Trade & Earn rewards through malicious behavior.
