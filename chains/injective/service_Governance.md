<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
To capture the attention of new and existing traders on Injective, the Injective Labs team proposes listing a pre-launch perpetual futures market for Pyth Network (PYTH). The oracle price will initially be calculated based on an 8 hour exponentially weighted moving average of the last traded prices taken each minute of the last day. When PYTH officially launches, the oracle price will be set to the Binance spot price so that the market converges upon the spot price upon launch. If the PYTH launch occurs prior to the passing of this proposal, then the market will become a regular perp market, with the oracle price being set to the Binance spot price of PYTH.

To promote trading activity across exchanges built on Injective within new markets, the Injective Labs team also proposes to boost the T&E multipliers for the PYTH/USDT PERP market to 50x, while resetting the multipliers for other markets. This will keep the T&E multiplier boosts meaningful rather than diluting the impact of the boosts between several markets.

Action

By voting YES on this proposal, you agree to launch the PYTH/USDT PERP market and update T&E multipliers based on the description above.

By voting NO on the proposal, you do not support launching the PYTH/USDT PERP market and updating T&E multipliers based on the description above.

By voting NO WITH VETO, you find this proposal to be (1) spam, i.e., irrelevant to the Injective ecosystem, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Injective governance. If the number of ‚ÄòNoWithVeto‚Äô votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the 500 INJ deposit is burned.

By voting ABSTAIN, you wish to contribute to quorum while formally declining to vote either for or against the proposal.
