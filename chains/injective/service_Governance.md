<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
This proposal, if passed, will update the min price tick and min quantity tick sizes for the SOL/USDT PERP market to 0.01 and 0.001, respectively. In addition, the initial margin ratios and maintenance margin ratios for both INJ/USDT PERP and ATOM/USDT PERP will be lowered to 0.095 and 0.05, respectively, allowing for a higher maximum leverage of 10x instead of 5x. The DOJO/INJ market‚Äôs min price tick and min quantity tick will be set to 0.000001 and 10, respectively, and maker/taker fees will be set to -0.01%/0.1%.

- By voting¬†YES¬†on this proposal, you agree to update the market parameters of the SOL/USDT PERP, INJ/USDT PERP, ATOM/USDT PERP, and DOJO/INJ markets as described above.

- By voting¬†NO¬†on the proposal, you do not support updating the parameters as described above.

- By voting NO WITH VETO, you find this proposal to be (1) spam, i.e., irrelevant to the Injective ecosystem, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Injective governance. If the number of ‚ÄòNoWithVeto‚Äô votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the 100 INJ deposit is burned.

- By voting¬†ABSTAIN, you wish to contribute to quorum while formally declining to vote either for or against the proposal.
