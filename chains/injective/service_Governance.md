<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
This proposal pertains to Sei and Celestia markets listed on exchange dApps built on Injective.
Specifically, SEI/USDT Perp market has recently been settled and the TIA/USDT-30NOV2023 Expiry Futures market will soon be settled. To ensure the popular SEI and TIA can still be traded as futures markets on Injective, both SEI/USDT Perp and TIA/USDT Perp should be present and listed here. Both markets will be using an oracle price feed provided by Pyth.
Action
By voting YES on this proposal, you agree to re-enable the SEI/USDT PERP market and launch the TIA/USDT PERP market.
By voting NO on the proposal, you do not support re-enabling the SEI/USDT PERP market and launching the TIA/USDT PERP market.
By voting NO WITH VETO, you find this proposal to be (1) spam, i.e., irrelevant to the Injective ecosystem, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Injective governance. If the number of â€˜NoWithVetoâ€™ votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the 500 INJ deposit is burned.
By voting ABSTAIN, you wish to contribute to quorum while formally declining to vote either for or against the proposal.
