This proposal, if passed, will adjust the Trade & Earn reward points for the epoch that ended on Oct 25.

The reward points for the following addresses will be adjusted to zero: inj1mqykgk8glnfevlu7xl0equkaq77djzm2n0g3zp

The community has presented evidence that these addresses have unfairly received Trade & Earn rewards through malicious behavior.

### ðŸ—³ 280: Trade and Earn Rewards Pool Update Epochs 104-111

<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
This proposal defines the rewards allocation of Trade & Earn from epoch 104 to epoch 111, which ends on 14 Nov 2023 09:00 (UTC). The Trade & Earn rewards program was approved by the Injective community to help support the trading volume of Injective and the growth of the exchange dApps built on Injective.

This proposal, if approved, will extend Trade & Earn rewards for another 8 weeks. The following is the breakdown of the rewards:

- Epoch 104 - 2,034 INJ

- Epoch 105 - 2,021 INJ

- Epoch 106 - 2,008 INJ

- Epoch 107 - 1,995 INJ

- Epoch 108 - 1,983 INJ

- Epoch 109 - 1,970 INJ

- Epoch 110 - 1,957 INJ

- Epoch 111 - 1,944 INJ

By voting YES on this proposal, you agree to spending 15,912 INJ from the community pool to promote trading activity on Injective.

By voting NO on the proposal, you do not support spending 15,912 INJ from the community pool to promote trading activity on Injective.

By voting NO WITH VETO, you find this proposal to (1) spam, i.e., irrelevant to the Injective ecosystem, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Injective governance. If the number of â€˜NoWithVetoâ€™ votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the 500 INJ deposit is burned.

By voting ABSTAIN, you wish to contribute to quorum but formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.
