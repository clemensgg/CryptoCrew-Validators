### üó≥ 318: Update min price tick and min quantity tick for GINGER/INJ on Injective Exchange dApps

<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
This proposal pertains to the GINGER/INJ spot market on the Injective orderbook.

Based on the current market price of GINGER, the current minimum price tick size is too large causing the price to deviate significantly from the price on other DEXes.

This proposal seeks to reduce the minimum price tick of GINGER/INJ from 10000 to 100 and increase the minimum quantity tick from 1000000000 to 10000000000.

- By voting YES on this proposal, you agree to update the min price tick for GINGER/INJ.

- By voting NO on the proposal, you do not support updating the min price tick for GINGER/INJ.

- By voting NO WITH VETO, you find this proposal to be (1) spam, i.e., irrelevant to the Injective ecosystem, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Injective governance. If the number of ‚ÄòNoWithVeto‚Äô votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the 100 INJ deposit is burned.

- By voting ABSTAIN, you wish to contribute to quorum while formally declining to vote either for or against the proposal.

### üó≥ 320: Whitelist address for new provider oracle

Summary

The purpose of this governance proposal is to whitelist a wallet to create new pricing feeds on demand.

Background

Every new token listing across Injective exchange dApps requires a new oracle feed, which currently must be approved individually through a new governance proposal. This is a suboptimal process as the community has to vote multiple times for redundant price feeds.

Proposal

This proposal will whitelist a wallet, currently maintained by Injective Labs, to create new price feeds instantly. This will be done to speed up the process for listing new tokens - specifically pre-launch perpetual futures tokens.

This proposal, if passed, will adjust the Trade & Earn reward points for the epoch that ended on January 10.

The reward points for the following addresses will be adjusted to zero: inj1cm86ly3qpml9zagtuhn64twy7mnxgdt8s6tt5p

The community has presented evidence that these addresses have unfairly received Trade & Earn rewards through malicious behavior.
