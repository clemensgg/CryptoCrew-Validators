This proposal, if passed, will adjust the Trade & Earn reward points for the epoch that ended on September 20.

The reward points for the following addresses will be adjusted to zero:

The community has presented evidence that these addresses have unfairly received Trade & Earn rewards through malicious behavior.

Pursuant to the forum post here: https://gov.injective.network/discussion/12607-trade-earn-20, the ecosystem proposes to boost rewards for new markets launched on Injective with higher multipliers in order to incentivize liquidity.

As a first step, this proposal will boost rewards for a few new listings on Injective exchange dApps with a 50x multiplier in the Trade and Earn Program:

- NEOK/USDT

- ORAI/USDT

- SEI/USDT PERP

Background

The Injective Oracle module will add a new feed from the Cosmos Ecosystem.

Proposal

This proposal, if passed, will allow a new price feed oracle to be integrated with Injective, the oracle will be maintained by an external party.

As was the case for proposal 118, new proposals will be submitted for additional price feed oracles to be integrated from the same source in the future.

Passing this proposal will enable the community to list new perpetual markets on Injective exchange dApps.
