DoraHacks is proposing the deployment of a Quadratic Funding contract natively on Injective, allowing Injective's ecosystem loyal community members to have a voice in supporting projects they value. The DoraHacks team together with the Injective Foundation would facilitate multiple Quadratic Funding rounds, enabling the distribution of community contributions and matching funds to Injective ecosystem projects. For more information refer to forum post: https://gov.injective.network/discussion/15042-deploying-injective-native-quadratic-funding-smart-contract
