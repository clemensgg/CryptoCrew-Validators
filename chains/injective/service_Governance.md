<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
Currently USDTkv markets are not eligible for fee discounts. To incentivize more taker flow, USDTkv markets should be made eligible for fee discounts. In addition, USDCnb should be added to allow for fee discounts in USDCnb markets in the future.

By voting YES on this proposal, you agree to make USDTkv and USDCnb quoted markets eligible for fee discounts.

By voting NO on the proposal, you do not support making USDTkv and USDCnb quoted markets eligible for fee discounts.

By voting NO WITH VETO, you find this proposal to be (1) spam, i.e., irrelevant to the Injective ecosystem, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Injective governance. If the number of ‚ÄòNoWithVeto‚Äô votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the 500 INJ deposit is burned.

By voting ABSTAIN, you wish to contribute to quorum while formally declining to vote either for or against the proposal.

Currently USDTkv markets are not eligible for T&E rewards because the denom has not been added to the program. To incentivize retail traders to adopt USDTkv, USDTkv markets should be added to T&E. In addition, USDCnb should be added to allow USDCnb markets to partake in T&E in the future.

By voting YES on this proposal, you agree to add USDTkv and USDCnb quoted markets to T&E.

By voting NO on the proposal, you do not support adding USDTkv and USDCnb quoted markets to T&E.

## Upload Ojo Oracle Contract Wasm Code

### Background

The Ojo Network is a Cosmos SDK based appchain which specializes in aggregating data from decentralized sources on the blockchain in a permissionless manner and relaying that information to other blockchains via cross-chain smart contracts and the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC).

### Summary

This proposal intends to upload the Ojo Oracle Contract for use by Levana on Injective.

The Levana team has agreed to use the Ojo Oracle in order to determine the price of assets for their deployment on Injective.

### About Ojo

Ojo uses a push-model price oracle contract which broadcasts regular price updates. Ojo is able to support a unique class of assets that are native to DEXes like Osmosis, Crescent, and Kujira‚Äôs FIN. As a result, Ojo is the only oracle which provides pricing info on all of Stride‚Äôs LSTs and other native tokens to the Cosmos. This also includes our Smart Oracle offering, which provides contextual market data about low-volume assets so that they can engage in DeFi safely.

Ojo has already been deployed to these Cosmos L1s: Osmosis, Juno, Comdex, Umee, Secret Network, Stargaze, and Archway.

### About Levana

Levana Perps is a protocol for perpetual swaps, which are leveraged trading contracts. It aims to manage risk and provide benefits to both traders and liquidity providers. Levana‚Äôs perpetual swaps protocol offers a reliable and secure platform for traders and liquidity providers. It ensures fair settlement, minimizes risks, and allows for the development of additional financial protocols on top of tokenized positions.

### Contract Information

### TL;DR

- Ojo is a Cosmos SDK based appchain which employs a push-model price oracle contract that broadcasts price updates.
- This proposal is to upload the Ojo Oracle Contract for Levana's use on Injective.

By voting YES on this proposal, you agree to uploading Ojo's Oracle Wasm Contract as described in this proposal.

By voting NO on the proposal, you do not support uploading Ojo's Oracle Wasm Contract as described in this proposal.

By voting NO WITH VETO, you find this proposal to be spam/irrelevant/malicious to governance, and contribute to burning 500 INJ deposit if NoWithVeto votes are greater than ‚Öì of the total voting power.

By voting ABSTAIN, you wish to contribute to quorum while formally declining to vote either for or against the proposal.
