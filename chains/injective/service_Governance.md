The community has presented evidence that these addresses have unfairly received Trade & Earn rewards through malicious behavior.

This proposal defines the rewards allocation of Trade & Earn from epoch 96 to epoch 103, which ends on 14 Nov 2023 09:00 (UTC). The Trade & Earn rewards program was approved by the Injective community to help support the trading volume of Injective and the growth of the exchange dApps built on Injective.

This proposal, if approved, will extend Trade & Earn rewards for another 8 weeks.

The following is the breakdown of the rewards:

- Epoch 96 - 2,136 INJ

- Epoch 97 - 2,123 INJ

- Epoch 98 - 2,111 INJ

- Epoch 99 - 2,098 INJ

- Epoch 100 - 2,085 INJ

- Epoch 101 - 2,072 INJ

- Epoch 102 - 2,059 INJ

- Epoch 103 - 2,047 INJ

By voting YES on this proposal, you agree to spending 16,731 INJ from the community pool to promote trading activity on Injective.

By voting NO on the proposal, you do not support spending 16,731 INJ from the community pool to promote trading activity on Injective.

By voting NO WITH VETO, you find this proposal to (1) spam, i.e., irrelevant to the Injective ecosystem, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Injective governance. If the number of ‚ÄòNoWithVeto‚Äô votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the 500 INJ deposit is burned.

By voting ABSTAIN, you wish to contribute to quorum but formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.
