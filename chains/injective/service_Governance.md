<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
In collaboration with Kava, the Injective Labs team proposes launching 4 new markets (KAVA/USDT, USDTkv/USDT, BTC/USDTkv Perp, and ETH/USDTkv Perp), in addition to adding KAVA rewards to the Open Liquidity Program for the new perp markets to incentivize adoption of Cosmos native USDT (USDTkv) on Injective.

More details on OLP KAVA rewards to come.
