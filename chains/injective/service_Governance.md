## Upload Ojo Oracle Contract Wasm Code

### Background

The Ojo Network is a Cosmos SDK based appchain which specializes in aggregating data from decentralized sources on the blockchain in a permissionless manner and relaying that information to other blockchains via cross-chain smart contracts and the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC).

### Summary

This proposal intends to upload the Ojo Oracle Contract for use by Levana on Injective.

The Levana team has agreed to use the Ojo Oracle in order to determine the price of assets for their deployment on Injective.

### About Ojo

Ojo uses a push-model price oracle contract which broadcasts regular price updates. Ojo is able to support a unique class of assets that are native to DEXes like Osmosis, Crescent, and Kujira‚Äôs FIN. As a result, Ojo is the only oracle which provides pricing info on all of Stride‚Äôs LSTs and other native tokens to the Cosmos. This also includes our Smart Oracle offering, which provides contextual market data about low-volume assets so that they can engage in DeFi safely.

Ojo has already been deployed to these Cosmos L1s: Osmosis, Juno, Comdex, Umee, Secret Network, Stargaze, and Archway.

### About Levana

Levana Perps is a protocol for perpetual swaps, which are leveraged trading contracts. It aims to manage risk and provide benefits to both traders and liquidity providers. Levana‚Äôs perpetual swaps protocol offers a reliable and secure platform for traders and liquidity providers. It ensures fair settlement, minimizes risks, and allows for the development of additional financial protocols on top of tokenized positions.

### TL;DR

- Ojo is a Cosmos SDK based appchain which employs a push-model price oracle contract that broadcasts price updates.
- This proposal is to upload the Ojo Oracle Contract for Levana's use on Injective.

By voting YES on this proposal, you agree to uploading Ojo's Oracle Wasm Contract as described in this proposal.

This proposal, if passed, will allow a new price feed oracle to be integrated with Injective, the oracle will be maintained by an external party.

As was the case for IIP-118, new proposals will be submitted for additional price feed oracles to be integrated from the same source in the future.

Passing this proposal will enable the community to list new perpetual markets on Injective exchange dApps.
