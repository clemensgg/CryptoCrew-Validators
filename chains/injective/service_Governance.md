<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
To promote trading activity across exchanges built on Injective within the new Celestia (TIA) markets, the Injective Labs team proposes to boost the T&E multipliers for the TIA markets to 50x, while resetting the multipliers for other markets. This will keep the T&E multiplier boosts meaningful rather than diluting the impact of the boosts between several markets.

Action

By voting YES on this proposal, you agree to update T&E multipliers based on the description above.

By voting NO on the proposal, you do not support updating T&E multipliers based on the description above.

By voting NO WITH VETO, you find this proposal to be (1) spam, i.e., irrelevant to the Injective ecosystem, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Injective governance. If the number of ‚ÄòNoWithVeto‚Äô votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the 500 INJ deposit is burned.

By voting ABSTAIN, you wish to contribute to quorum while formally declining to vote either for or against the proposal.

The community has presented evidence that these addresses have unfairly received Trade & Earn rewards through malicious behavior.
