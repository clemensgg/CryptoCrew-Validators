<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
To promote trading activity in new markets (KAVA/USDT, TIA/USDT Expiry Futures, and AXL/USDT PERP are to be launched soon pending governance), the Injective Labs team proposes boosting the T&E multipliers for the three markets listed above to 50x, while resetting the multipliers for NEOK/USDT and ORAI/USDT to 1x. This will keep the T&E multiplier boosts meaningful rather than diluting the impact of the boosts between several markets. Any markets with a non-50x boost from the legacy T&E program will also have their multipliers reset to 1x to maximize the impact of the boosts.

Action

By voting YES on this proposal, you agree to update T&E multipliers based on the description above.

By voting NO on the proposal, you do not support updating T&E multipliers based on the description above.

By voting NO WITH VETO, you find this proposal to be (1) spam, i.e., irrelevant to the Injective ecosystem, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Injective governance. If the number of ‚ÄòNoWithVeto‚Äô votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the 500 INJ deposit is burned.

By voting ABSTAIN, you wish to contribute to quorum while formally declining to vote either for or against the proposal.

To capture the attention of new and existing traders on Injective, the Injective Labs team proposes listing a pre-launch expiry futures market for TIA (Celestia). The market is currently set to expire on Nov 30, 2023. The oracle price will initially be calculated based on an 8 hour exponentially weighted moving average of the last traded prices taken each minute of the last day. When TIA officially launches, the oracle price will be set to the spot price so that upon expiry/settlement, the market converges upon the spot price.

By voting YES on this proposal, you support launching the market described above.

By voting NO on the proposal, you do not support launching the market described above.

By voting NO WITH VETO, you find this proposal to (1) be spam, i.e., irrelevant to the Injective ecosystem, (2) disproportionately infringe on minority interests, or (3) violate or encourage violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Injective governance. If the number of ‚ÄòNoWithVeto‚Äô votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the 500 INJ deposit is burned.

By voting ABSTAIN, you wish to contribute to quorum but formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.
