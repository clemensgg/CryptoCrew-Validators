The community has presented evidence that these addresses have unfairly received Trade & Earn rewards through malicious behavior.

This proposal confirms the final Open Liquidity Program market maker performance of epoch 24 as well as the distribution of 57648.093 INJ tokens, of which 27648.098 INJ are the OLP vested amount from epoch 21, and 29999.995 INJ are 50% of the OLP rewards allocated to epoch 24.

<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
To promote trading activity in new markets (KAVA/USDT, TIA/USDT Expiry Futures, and AXL/USDT PERP are to be launched soon pending governance), the Injective Labs team proposes boosting the T&E multipliers for the three markets listed above to 50x, while resetting the multipliers for NEOK/USDT and ORAI/USDT to 1x. This will keep the T&E multiplier boosts meaningful rather than diluting the impact of the boosts between several markets. Any markets with a non-50x boost from the legacy T&E program will also have their multipliers reset to 1x to maximize the impact of the boosts.

Action

By voting YES on this proposal, you agree to update T&E multipliers based on the description above.

By voting NO on the proposal, you do not support updating T&E multipliers based on the description above.

By voting NO WITH VETO, you find this proposal to be (1) spam, i.e., irrelevant to the Injective ecosystem, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Injective governance. If the number of ‚ÄòNoWithVeto‚Äô votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the 500 INJ deposit is burned.

By voting ABSTAIN, you wish to contribute to quorum while formally declining to vote either for or against the proposal.
