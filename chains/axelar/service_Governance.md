### Project Description:nThe KYVE Foundation has covered the costs of integrating [Axelar into the KYVE nprotocol](https://app.kyve.network/#/sources/axelar-dojo-1) to provide historicalndata validation and archiving and access to its suite of data tooling.nnTo maintain a healthy live-height sync, the KYVE Foundation requests to receive na delegation to run a Public Good validator in the Axelar Network and use the ngenerated returns to keep the integration (data pool) running and consistently ncaught up to live-height. KYVE Public Good validator will participate to the nquadratic consensus for EVM bridges.nn### Impact:nThis project would prove to be a mutually beneficial opportunity for both Axelar nand KYVE. It would allow Axelar to leverage a delegation to fund the noff-boarding of their historical data for optimal scalability and avoid costly narchival nodes, while also expanding KYVE‚Äôs trustless data sets and capabilities.nnIn doing so, this historical data is made a trustless public good for the Axelar necosystem to leverage for free along with [KYVE tooling](https://docs.kyve.network/), such as:nn- KSYNC: Nodes are at the heart of blockchains. To enhance the node experience n and overall scalability, KSYNC enables rapid node syncing to any historic n block state, or height of a chain made trustless by KYVE.n- Trustless API: Via KYVE‚Äôs trustless API, developers can connect their n applications to KYVE trustless data within seconds. The Trustless API serves n validated data for free, thereby making it accessible to everyone.n- Data Pipeline: For analytics purposes like explorers, marketing tools, or n accounting solutions, developers need to be able to analyze big data sets n quickly. KYVE‚Äôs Data Pipeline enables just that, providing a customizable n no-code solution for importing trustless data into BigQuery, Snowflake, n MongoDB, and others. nnAdditionally, the KYVE foundation will delegate 40.000 $KYVE to each Axelar nprotocol validators joining the Axelar data pool on the KYVE protocol layer for nthem to safeguard Axelar historical data. With the data pool being funded by ncommission rewards from the public good validator delegation, the validators nand delegators participating in this data pool will be rewarded in $AXL tokens.nnnFor more detailed information, please check the forum post: n[KYVE Network Public Good Funding](https://community.axelar.network/t/axelar-kyve-foundation-kyve-network-public-good-funding/2939)n
