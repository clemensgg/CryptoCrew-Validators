# Developer Onboarding Funding Proposal 2n> [From this discussion page](https://github.com/orgs/akash-network/discussions/633)n## IntroductionnThe program previously targeting marketing and education is back after two successful runs! This time, we are aiming to introduce a way to make it run year-round without breaks, improve the education, and to incentivize direct contributions to Akash.n[Details from the first proposal](https://github.com/orgs/akash-network/discussions/457)n[Presented results from the first proposal](https://github.com/orgs/akash-network/discussions/599)n## Expected outcomesnWe will include 1-5 missions from each category each month from deploying, providing, marketing, and direct contribution. Our goal is to have some missions be available at all times, such as developing and deploying an app to Akash. Examples from each category includes developing & deploying an app with a new feature, creating a helpful script for providers or running a certain provider, creating an useful text/video guide, and finding and fixing errors in the documentation.nThe last category, direct contribution, is aiming to increase the number of core contributors to the network and technical projects requesting funds via governance proposals. The more core contributors the network gets, the more people will be active in WGs/SIGs plus on GitHub and on other platforms. The other three are here to get more developers familiar with Akash and at least temporarily boost network statistics in provider and deployment counts.nWe are aiming to have one bi-weekly meeting for the WG-call and another one for assisting users and answering technical questions. Besides this, both of us have private meetings - usually bi-weekly - talking about how to best create missions and any other details happening behind the scenes such as if we need to prepare anything or do anything before a WG-call.nFurthermore we are expecting to increase the number of users to a total of 500-750 unique users across the different categories. This is roughly double the current user count.n## Resources requiredn> 1x community manager (taking the lead on wg-zealy calls; writing announcements; paying out rewards; interacting & making final decisions, etc)n> 1x administrator (reviewing missions, giving technical support, creating helper scripts, finalizing details, etc)n> (+ a common collaborative effort on creating tasks and running other meetings)nFor the increased amount of work from the previous proposal, we are now requesting $2000/contributor/month.nFurthermore, we are planning to use $3000 USD/month for rewards. As we already have $8k USD at the time of writing, mostly from Greg's donation, we are only going to request the difference of $4000 USD unless it changes.n## Proposal fundingnWe are also proposing asking for funding for at least 4 months at a time while reporting every 3 months to ensure that we can make the program run without breaks. One period can be between months 1-3 and then this will be reported on, and any changes/discussion will be made during the 4th month. The 4th month would be included in the next report and months 5 and 6 would include potential changes from the discussion on month 4. With our current system we have been unable to run the program without breaks because we plan the new periods during the breaks.nIf no changes are made, we will request funding for 4 months for a total balance of $20000 USD making the total request to be approximately $12000 USD after keeping the rewards pool donation in mind.
