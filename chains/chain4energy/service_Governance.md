**Enhancement of Token Economics and 100M C4E Token Burn Prior to Listing**

This initiative aims to refine the tokenomics of C4E, reducing the Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) by burning 100M C4E to bolster the project's position for its upcoming listing. We propose a series of strategic adjustments to the token distribution and vesting strategies, enhancing the project's economic structure and attractiveness to future investors.

**Proposed Actions:**

1. Adjustment of Strategic Reserve:

- Strategic Reserve Short Term Round Pool: We recommend reducing the *Strategic Reserve Short Term Round Pool* by 20 million C4E to better align our token distribution with our long-term vision. Concurrently, this pool will be renamed to *Marketing Pool* to more accurately reflect its intended use.

- Renaming Strategic Reserve: Transition the naming of the *Strategic Reserve pool* to *Grants/Ecosystem Growth,*reflecting a broadened focus on supporting ecosystem development and growth initiatives.

2. Token Transfer for Liquidity: To ensure adequate liquidity upon listing, we propose transferring 10 million C4E from the Strategic Reserve Short Term account to the Liquidity Pool account. This will provide a robust foundation for CEX/DEX liquidity.

3. Token Burn Initiative: We plan to burn the surplus tokens in the Strategic Reserve account, leaving a total of 50 million C4E. This action is aimed at decreasing the total token supply,potentially increasing the token's value for current holders.

4. Consolidation of Funding Rounds: The Validator and VC round pools will be merged into the Seed round pool, simplifying our funding structure.

5. Revision of Vesting Terms All Rounds:

- Modify the vesting conditions for the Validator and VC round pools. The new terms will offer 8% of tokens freely available at launch, a shortened lockup period of 4 months, and an accelerated vesting period of 10 months.

- Private Round Adjustment: 11M C4E with an initial release of 15%, lockup for 2 months, and a vesting period of 7 months.

- Public Round Adjustment: 6M C4E with an initial release of 20%, lockup for 1 month, and a vesting period of 5 months.

6. Community Pool Reallocation: The allocation to the community pool will be reduced from 100 million to 40 million C4E, allowing for a strategic redistribution of resources essential for the project's longevity and prosperity.

7. Initial Circulating Supply Adjustment: Lowering the initial circulating supply without liquidity bello 10M C4E, refining our market entry strategy and enhancing token value prospects for early adopters and stakeholders.

8. Technical migration of private and public Round pools to multisig account 2/3 c4e1p0smw03cwhqn05fkalfpcr0ngqv5jrpnx2cp54. The reason is the technical flexibility of token allocation for IDOs and token sales. Unsold tokens will be transferred to the liquidity pool for a future DEX/CEX LP build.

**Justification:**

The proposed strategic adjustments to the token economy are designed to enhance the project's appeal and market readiness while ensuring a fair and sustainable approach to token distribution. These measures aim to increase confidence and support among our community and investors, laying a strong foundation for C4E's future success.

**Tests conducted:**

- Simulation tests

- Performance/stability tests

- Manual E2E tests

- Automatic E2E tests

- Unit tests

**Details of Upgrade**

The proposal is for an upgrade in block **7372232** to be held on **28.02.2024 14:00 UTC**. Remember that block times have a lot of variability, so keep an eye on the time. The update is expected to take approximately 15 minutes during which there will be no activity on the network.
