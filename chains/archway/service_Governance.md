## Summary nThe Geccoverse is a Tamagochi-style digital universe where users can birth and nurture a gecco, grow it, showcase it and interact with their fellow geccos about all things gecco-related. The focus is on creating a digital fan experience for the music band 100 gecs, an internet-native hyperpop band, but the game is open for everyone. We leverage Archway to provide NFT DAO tech and focus on ease of onboarding through research into account abstraction paired with the Unity game engine. Through the collection of internal and external feedback & metrics, practices are distilled into an incubator program framework and pitched to art institutions, developer schools and traditional investors with the intent of founding an economically sustainable incubator program. n[Proposal Forum Post](https://gov.archway.io/t/funding-proposal-the-geccoverse-a-txart-pilot-project-exploring-the-intersection-between-art-and-technology-from-a-story-first-paradigm/384) n ## Funding Request nWe request 1.25M ARCH be deposited to a 3/5 multi-sig with the following members: n- Max - Phi-Labs n- Mike - Archway Foundation n- Phunky - LuckyFriday n- Eric - Astrovault n- Ilo - GraviDAO nnThe ARCH will be distributed on a bi-weekly schedule according to the milestones outlined in the proposal.
