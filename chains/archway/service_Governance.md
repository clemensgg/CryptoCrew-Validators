<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
Introduction: As a community, it is important to ensure that we have a way to control community spend funds to ensure that spends are impactful, proposers are accountable, and that each funded initiative meets the stated goals and objectives. Our solution is to create an optional Community Spend DAO, that the community can choose to invoke when spends are high or projects are multistep and critical.nnWe propose the following structure: The Community DAO would comprise 7 members: 2 Phi Labs employees, 1 Foundation member, 2 validators and 2 Archway ecosystem developers. Its sole purpose would be to execute the will of the community, as agreed upon through on-chain governance.nnTo read the full proposal, template when using the guardrials and join forum discussion here: https://gov.archway.io/t/signaling-proposal-governance-community-spend-guardrails/314
