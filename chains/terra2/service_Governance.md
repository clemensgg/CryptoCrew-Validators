<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
This is a proposal to add the ALLY token to the Terra blockchain as an Alliance asset, allowing the AllianceDAO NFT contract to stake ALLY to Terra validators and accrue LUNA staking rewards. LUNA staking rewards accrued by ALLY will be distributed to and locked into unbroken AllianceDAO NFTs. The proposed reward weight is .008 (A projected 0.72% of LUNA staking rewards) with a 0% take rate. By adding ALLY as an Alliance asset, this prop seeks to establish a unique role for AllianceDAO in promoting the adoption and evolution of the Alliance module for Terra and its community. As a leading force driving the success of Alliance throughout Cosmos, AllianceDAO‚Äôs ultimate goal is to draw new users and activity back to Terra for the benefit of the Terra ecosystem.
