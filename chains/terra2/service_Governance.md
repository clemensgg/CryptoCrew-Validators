This is a proposal to add the ALLY token to the Terra blockchain as an Alliance asset, allowing the AllianceDAO NFT contract to stake ALLY to Terra validators and accrue LUNA staking rewards. LUNA staking rewards accrued by ALLY will be distributed to and locked into unbroken AllianceDAO NFTs. The proposed reward weight is .008 (A projected 0.72% of LUNA staking rewards) with a 0% take rate. By adding ALLY as an Alliance asset, this prop seeks to establish a unique role for AllianceDAO in promoting the adoption and evolution of the Alliance module for Terra and its community. As a leading force driving the success of Alliance throughout Cosmos, AllianceDAO‚Äôs ultimate goal is to draw new users and activity back to Terra for the benefit of the Terra ecosystem.

This is a proposal to add the ampROAR token to the Terra blockchain as an Alliance asset, allowing ampROAR holders to stake ampROAR to Terra validators and accrue LUNA staking rewards. ampROAR is an autocompounding liquid staking token of ROAR, the Lion DAO governance token, developed by Eris Protocol who are a prominent LST provider across Cosmos but born on Terra. The proposed reward weight is .004 (A projected 0.36% of LUNA staking rewards) with a 0% take rate and includes a 21 day unbonding period. By adding ampROAR as an alliance asset, this prop seeks to establish a unique role for Lion DAO in promoting the adoption and evolution of the Alliance module for Terra and its community by demonstrating the ability to form internal alliances on a chain to support active projects that bring value to the chain. Lion DAO has demonstrated it's value to the Terra blockchain by having the widest token distribution, deepest liquidity and highest Market Cap of any Terra native token as well as being associated with ~5% of all on-chain txs in the last 12 months.
