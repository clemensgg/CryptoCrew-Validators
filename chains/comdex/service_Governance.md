**Summary:**
 This is an on-chain proposal to add the incentives to cSwap pools. We opened the discussion to the community on our forum to add the liquidity incentives for phase-41 on cSwap DEX by allocating 71,565 CMDX for an extended period of 14 days - to be distributed per the model for liquidity rewards. 

The pools would be incentivised as per the discussion on the forum. 

**Detailed Forum discussion about the incentive distribution:**
