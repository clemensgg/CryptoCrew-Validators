Please disregard the previous proposal.nnThis proposal stands for funding ($6500 in $STARS) PLStaking: A Soft-Staking Platform.nnIntroductionnnThe Stargaze community is at a crossroads, where the development of soft-staking platforms is hindered by inherent limitations. We propose a decentralized platform, focused exclusively on soft-staking, to empower creators and collectors in the Stargaze ecosystem. In addition, we believe that the competition we will bring will improve all platforms.nCurrent Challenges:nnConflicts of InterestnnIssue: Projects tied to soft-staking platforms have divergent interests, causing delays.nImpact: Even minor features take weeks to implement, hindering platform evolution.nnBudget LimitationnnIssue: Most projects lack the funds for sustained blockchain development.nImpact: This leads to compromised security and code quality, impacting overall platform health.nnProposed SolutionnDecentralized Soft-Staking PlatformnObjective: Create a community-centric platform, dedicated to soft-staking within the Stargaze ecosystem.nnFunding:nnManaged by a DAO, ensuring transparency and community involvement.nnDAO Members:nnBernynnborderlessnnCosmos KiwisnnLe ThangnnVicnnPrimusCryptusnnTimiusnnnDAO Link: https://daodao.zone/dao/stars1wtpm5qe7v027plfg8lad98xf02kqd03we6l2400ser5qnltplngq82ef3e/homennPurpose: Serve as a gateway for enthusiastic collectors in Stargaze, lacking resources for utility provision.nRoadmap and PlansnAt PLStaking, our guiding principle is rooted in the “S” of the S.O.L.I.D Principles—specifically, the “Single Responsibility Principle.” We firmly believe that decentralized applications (dApps) should serve the purpose for which they are created.
