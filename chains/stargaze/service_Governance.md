As we approach the next Stargaze Thirdening on January 1st, 2024, daily STARS emissions will be reduced by 1/3. This will have the following impact on the STARS token and it's inflation:n- Daily emissions will drop from 730k to 487k STARS per day. This will result in a yearly inflation of 7.21% (which is lower than other major Cosmos chains like ATOM or OSMO)n- The issued supply on January 1st 2024 will be 2.46B Stars, or put differently, 82.2% of the total supply will be issued.n- The community pool currently holds 817M STARS, which is about 1/3 of the current supply. (POL initiatives like the Liquidity DAO, staking supplementation or a potential future fundraiser will help to downsize the bloated CP.)nnFollowing [Prop #165 - Tokenomics 2.0](https://www.mintscan.io/stargaze/proposals/165) 6 months ago the supplement pool was funded with 18M STARS to cover for six months, this prop requests 40M STARS to be supplemented at a rate of 7.46 STARS/block which will cover 2024.nnAccount to be funded is the supplement pool:nhttps://rest.stargaze-apis.com/cosmos/auth/v1beta1/module_accounts/supplement_poolnnDiscussion Thread:nhttps://commonwealth.im/stargaze/discussion/14600-supplementing-stakers-for-the-emission-cut-after-the-sg-thirdeningnnTokenomics Doc:nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12zFTYowqDBOlUNvfaWSvXH3mhsFKemWRuA3uqAYKpyY/edit?usp=sharing
