This is a funding proposal (100k STARS) to reward reports of stolen collections on Stargaze.nnStargaze has permissionless collection deployment on-chain, meaning anyone can launch a collection on Stargaze anytime. This aligns with the fundamental principle of decentralization.nnHowever, that also opens up to scammers, allowing them to deploy a stolen collection from another chain into Stargaze.nAction is taken upon noticing the collection is stolen - usually, the team gets to it fairly quickly. There are times, though, when we would need a swift response or more eyes to discover those before any damage is made to the community.nnThis proposal was made with the feedback from STARS hodlers on Stargaze Discord.nnWe are requesting a small amount of funds (100k STARS) that will last for many months.nEvery successful first report would be rewarded by a small amount of STARS (1k-2k), but always less than collection creation to avoid gaming (for example, creating a collection and reporting themselves). 1/1 collection reports will be at a lower amount since they also cost less to launch.nFor this purpose, we will open a channel on Stargaze Discord that has new messages every time a new collection is launched. ( ‚Å†# new-collections )nOnly the first report for a collection will be considered for the reward. To be eligible, will need to have a link to the original collection at the marketplace.nThis is for copy/paste collections only (exact same art). Heavy references are more of a gray area and not contemplated by this.nnThe funds will be managed by a DAO, with the following members:nStartynSerkannbonzinRuwannnDAO Link:nhttps://daodao.zone/dao/stars10c9ktyv3xf5vd2hxcxzekg3mzcn58p75gzhp0uepsa57p4qvsf3qgaql92nnThe main purpose of this funding is to get to a stolen collection quickly - ideally before any minting has happened - so the community isn‚Äôt harmed by the scammers. This will also, over time, de-incentivize scammers from deploying on Stargaze, as they will notice they won‚Äôt be able to keep their stolen collections or earn any revenue from it.nnOther measures are being discussed - for example, vesting the revenue for some days until the collection is checked - but this will require changes in the coding and will take a bit longer to implement.nnBy voting YES to this proposal, you agree to send 100k STARS to the DAO above mentioned, funding that will be sent as rewards for reporting stolen collections.nnBy voting NO to this proposal, you are against sending funds to the DAO to reward users for reporting stolen collections.
