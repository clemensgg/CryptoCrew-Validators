<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
This proposal aims to make the Stargaze network permissionless for smart contract deployment, removing the need for a passing governance proposal for each contract deployment. More details can be found on the forum discussion: https://gov.stargaze.zone/discussion/13347-enabling-permissionless-smart-contract-deployment. Please vote NO on proposal 225 as it was made by accident; this is the correct proposal for enabling permissionless Smart Contract Deployment.
