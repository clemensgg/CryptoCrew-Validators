<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
With the current surge in the $STARS price, the creation fee became more expensive. In the future, we would like to have the price based on a USD value, to avoid the current fluctuations.nWhile integrating with the Oracle still needs some time to be launched, the Stargaze team would like to propose the following fees in USD:nnType | USD Base Value proposed |tReferencenStandard collection |t99 USDt-nOpen Edition |t33 USDt| 1/3 of Standard Collection feenMigrate to Updatable |t66 USD |t2/3 of Standard Collection feenUpdatable |t165 USDt| Standard + Migration feenWL Flex (non featured) |t165 USD |tSame as UpdatablenWL Flex (featured) |t495 USDt| 3x from WL Flex-non-featurednn*The fees will be adjusted to the base USD price from this proposal if there is a big change either upwards or downwards of the STARS token price. nThat means if STARS gets to 2x from the current value, we will lower creation fees by half. If STARS lowers to half from the current value, we will double the creation fees, keeping the same ‚Äústable‚Äù USD price.n*The adjustment will happen until we have the Oracle in place.nnAs a reminder, all fees are Fairburned. None go towards Stargaze/Stargaze team. 50% is burned and 50% goes back to Stakers.nnBy voting YES to this proposal, you agree to set a USD value for each Collection Creation Fee, which will be adjusted accordingly from time to time by the Stargaze Team.nBy voting NO to this proposal, you don‚Äôt agree to set a USD value, keeping the collection creation fee as is.nBy voting NO WITH VETO, you believe this proposal is malicious and that there should be a penalty to the current proposer.
