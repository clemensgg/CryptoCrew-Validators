# Stargaze v12 Upgrade

This upgrade adds a new module, updates to CosmWasm, and bugfixes.

- packet-forward-middleware
- wasmd v0.33 with 1_2 and 1_3 capabilities


## Details of upgrade time
This proposal suggests block #9796507 for the upgrade, which is estimated to be at Wednesday 30th August 15:00 UTC, using avg block time of 5.87 secs https://www.mintscan.io/stargaze/blocks/9796507
When the network reaches the halt height, the state machine of the blockchain will be halted. Cosmovisor, if configured properly, will then switch the binary used for v12.0.0, and then the chain will continue to make progress.
In the event of an issue at upgrade time, we will coordinate via the #verified-validators channel in Discord.
