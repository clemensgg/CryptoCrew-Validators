# Stargaze Proposal: Deploying Interchain NFT Contracts (aka Outgoing Proxy and ICS721 Contracts)nn## Introduction:nnThe ICS721 Super Team is on the brink of a transformative change within the Cosmos ecosystem, spearheading the drive for interchain NFT transfers. With this proposal, we aim to deploy the critical contracts essential for these transfers across Stargaze, Juno, and Terra.nn## Summary:nnCentral to this proposal is the deployment of interchain NFT (ICS721 and outgoing proxy) contracts. After their deployment, Ark Protocol will initiate these contracts, establishing the foundation of our managed infrastructure to serve the cross-chain NFT community. While the ecosystem permits individual instantiation, contracts and channels endorsed by Stargaze and Ark Protocol will be officially recognized, strengthening community trust and security.nn---nn## Managed Interchain NFT Services (Condensed):nn- **Infrastructure Mastery**: Automated deployment of interchain NFT contracts on CosmWasm chains, enhanced by rigorous monitoring and fluid relayer setups.n- Service Provisions:n - **Community Engagement**: Proactive support, regular educational initiatives, and open dialogue sessions to foster a well-informed community.n - **Active Contribution**: Direct involvement in shaping the specifications and building robust contracts, ensuring they align with community needs and technological advancements.n - **Safety Measures**: Introduction of outgoing proxy contracts, meticulous whitelisting, transfer rate control, and emergency mechanisms.n- **DevOps Excellence**: A harmonized approach, merging development and operations, to create a robust interchain NFT infrastructure.nn---nn## Rollout Plan:nn1. Commence with the whitelisting of an initial collection.n2. Gather invaluable feedback from our community.n3. Refine and improve based on the feedback.n4. Systematically expand the whitelist‚Äôs scope.n5. Ultimate aspiration: Offer contracts accessibility to all collections.nn---nn## Multisig Details:nn- Operations Multisig (Owner wallet: stars1tah0nyhr9avcue34wtl8w8gh0p6zwv0epklr3d): 6 signers (3 from Ark Protocol, 3 from Stargaze), threshold of 2.n- Migration Multisig (Admin wallet: stars1a7esxnnl5cgv3j93g9flz7rkqtsqd9mgz78fvw): 6 signers (3 from Ark Protocol, 3 from Stargaze), threshold of 3, dedicated to potential contract migrations.nn---nn## Foundation for Upcoming Endeavors:nUpon deployment, the stage is set for the next chapter: bridging interchain NFT transfers with Ethereum, expanding our interchain reach.nn---nn## Reference to Key Publications:n1.
