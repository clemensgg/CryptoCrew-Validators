<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
Proposal #27 allowed to extend the store code permissions such that an additional wallet address by the Nolus team is able to store code on-chain without the need to go through governance proposal. In that way, there needs to be only one proposal for migration afterwards. As a result, the proposal count was reduced significantly which makes it easier for the community to track the version of the smart contracts. On the other hand, this meant that contracts that are stored on-chain via this additional address, remain unpinned. nnCode pinning is a mechanism that allows contract code IDs to be pinned to memory. This way code does not have to be loaded to memory on each execution which in turn reduces the gas requirement for each transaction involving that contract. This would make the follow-up smart contract migration proposal to be submitted for much less gas than it would cost without the contracts being pinned. nnBy voting YES to this proposal you agree to pin the contract IDs of the Admin, Leaser, LPP, Profit, Oracle, Time Alarms, Treasury, Rewards Dispatcher and Lease smart contracts.
