# Raise the minimum utilization thresholdn## SummarynCurrently, the lending pool prevents new deposits from entering it once the utilization rate drops below 50%. This primarily prevents the real yield portion of the rewards to get diluted, since the larger the ratio between lenders and borrowers, the lower the yield each of them is entitled to. 
 nThis proposal aims to raise the minimum utilization rate threshold to 65%, thereby primarily contributing to two factors: 

n* Lenders receiving better yield as new deposits will be stopped from entering the system until the 65% mark; 
n* Pushing the utilization rate closer to the optimal level which is 70%.

nBy voting YES on this proposal, you agree to make these adjustments to the LPP smart contract and allow the protocol to raise the minimum utilization threshold to 65%.
