# v0.4.2 Nolus Pirin Software Upgradenn## SummarynThis on-chain upgrade governance proposal is to adopt v0.4.2 for the Nolus Pirin mainnet which is currently running on v0.4.1. By voting YES to this proposal, you approve of adding these updates to the base layer protocol. This update seeks to introduce the following: 

n* Introduce the x/authz module. It allows an account (granter) to grant arbitrary privileges to another account (grantee) to execute transactions on their behalf. 
n* Add CosmWasm 1.2. It delivers important new features such as calculation of a smart contract address in advance. 
nn## ChangesnA complete changelog can be seen in the v0.4.2 release on [github](https://github.com/nolus-protocol/nolus-core/releases/tag/v0.4.2).nn## On-Chain Upgrade ProcessnWhen the network reaches the halt height, the state machine program of Nolus will be halted. The classic method for upgrading requires all validators and node operators to manually substitute the existing state machine binary with the new binary.nValidators can coordinate with each other on Discord in advance of the release. Please use the chat channel under the Validators section.nThe target block for the scheduled update is 3044000 which should happen on the 13th of December, 2023 (Wednesday) at around 09:15 UTC. As a disclaimer, this is a rough estimate assuming an average block time of 5.76 seconds.
