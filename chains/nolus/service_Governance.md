# v0.5.0 Nolus Pirin Twilight Upgradenn## SummarynThis on-chain upgrade governance proposal is to adopt v0.5.0 for the Nolus Pirin mainnet which is currently running on v0.4.2. By voting YES to this proposal, you approve of adding these updates to the base layer protocol. This upgrade introduces: 

n* Cosmos SDK v0.47 which brings many structural changes to the base layer impacting positively the overall performance and functionality; 
n* Fee abstraction which allows users to pay gas in denoms other than unls; 
n* Bump to v1.5.2 of the wasmvm which solves memory leak issues. 
nn## ChangesnA complete changelog can be seen in the v0.5.0 release on [github](https://github.com/nolus-protocol/nolus-core/releases/tag/v0.5.0).nn## On-Chain Upgrade ProcessnWhen the network reaches the halt height, the state machine program of Nolus will be halted. The classic method for upgrading requires all validators and node operators to manually substitute the existing state machine binary with the new binary.nValidators can coordinate with each other on Discord in advance of the release. Please use the chat channel under the Validators section.nThe target block for the scheduled update is 3659000 which should happen on the 23rd of January, 2024 (Tuesday) at around 12:00 UTC. As a disclaimer, this is a rough estimate assuming an average block time of 5.75 seconds.
