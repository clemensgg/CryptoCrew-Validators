# Migrate contracts to v0.3.5n## SummarynIn order to perform contract instantiations or migrations, these need to pass through governance since the Nolus network 
 is a semi-permissioned blockchain.nThis proposal aims to migrate a new version of the Leaser smart contract (v0.3.5) on the Nolus Pirin mainnet. This update seeks to simply bump the version of the Leaser contract which could not be migrated with the previous v0.3.4.nThe complete changelog can be seen in the Github [release v0.3.5](https://github.com/nolus-protocol/nolus-money-market/releases/tag/v0.3.5).nBy voting YES on this proposal, you agree to migrate this new version of the smart contracts.
