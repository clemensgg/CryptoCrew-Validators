# Whitelist nolus1zgzdzq8aqxff3naz37594tjfgt7aqde600cm0n as the first price feeder for the Neutron Astroport Oracle smart contractnn## SummarynOracle market data price feeders are an essential part of the Nolus core architecture which uses its own Oracle system. Each price feeding service is an independent lightweight off-chain component that retrieves prices from configured price providers for a set of denomination pairs. With the latest Astroport integration on Neutron, there are now two providers from which the Oracle system of Nolus can retrieve prices - Osmosis and Neutron. The price feeders utilize a variant of the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) algorithm for the price calculation of any given cryptocurrency pair. Through the use of this algorithm, one can put additional weights on more recently observed prices for a given period. To read more about the role of the price feeders in Nolus, have a look at the [documentation](https://hub.nolus.io/en_US/technical-documentation/oracles-alarms).nnBy voting YES on this proposal, you agree to whitelist the first price feeder for the Astroport Oracle smart contract. Each service is located in a different geolocation and is configured to push a price every 60 seconds.nn## Source codenEach price feeding service is built from the [oracle-price-feeder](https://github.com/nolus-protocol/oracle-price-feeder) repository. You can find the configuration for a feeder running on mainnet [here](https://github.com/nolus-protocol/oracle-price-feeder/blob/main/configurations/market-data-feeder.main.toml).
